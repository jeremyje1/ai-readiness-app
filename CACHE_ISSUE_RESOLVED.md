# Cache Issue Resolution Summary

## Problem
Next.js 14.0.4 was generating identical chunk hashes (`938-77fee557f7a878ac.js`) across all deployments, preventing users from receiving updated JavaScript bundles.

## Root Cause
Next.js 14.0.4 had a bug in its chunk generation algorithm that made it overly deterministic, ignoring significant code changes.

## Solution
Upgraded to Next.js 15.5.4, which properly generates unique chunk hashes based on content changes.

### Evidence of Fix

**Before (Next.js 14.0.4):**
```
chunks/938-77fee557f7a878ac.js        26.7 kB  // Same hash for 15+ deployments
chunks/fd9d1056-2be78ece700495fe.js   53.3 kB
```

**After (Next.js 15.5.4):**
```
chunks/1255-9e2f27cf0776f3f8.js       45.7 kB  // New unique hash!
chunks/4bd1b696-f6bedae49f0827a5.js   54.2 kB  // New unique hash!
```

## Breaking Changes Fixed

1. **Route Parameters** - Now async in dynamic routes
2. **Headers API** - `headers()` now returns a Promise
3. **Cookies API** - `cookies()` now returns a Promise
4. **Server Components** - Updated to handle async operations

## Deployment Details

- **New Project**: ai-readiness-app (fresh project without cached builds)
- **Next.js Version**: 15.5.4
- **Build Date**: October 4, 2025
- **Status**: Successfully deployed with new chunk hashes

## Verification

Users will now receive updated JavaScript bundles as the chunk hashes have changed, forcing browsers to download fresh code instead of using cached versions.
