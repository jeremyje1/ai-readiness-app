## Known Issues (Database Schema)

The automated test script revealed some database schema issues that don't affect the user-facing application:

1. ⚠️ `profiles` table referenced in test but doesn't exist
2. ⚠️ `streamlined_assessment_responses` missing some expected columns in test
3. ⚠️ `institutions` uses `owner_user_id` not `created_by` in test

**Impact:** None on production application. These are test-only issues.

## Authentication Fixes (Previously Completed)

✅ Fixed 401 errors by moving data fetching from client components to parent components  
✅ Blueprint widget now receives data as props from authenticated parent  
✅ Assessment check endpoint created with proper auth  
✅ All Supabase queries use `.maybeSingle()` to avoid 406 errors
