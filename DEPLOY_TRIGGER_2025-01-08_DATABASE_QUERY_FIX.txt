DEPLOYMENT TRIGGER - DATABASE QUERY 406 ERRORS FIX
Date: 2025-01-08
Purpose: Fix 406 errors from Supabase queries

Issues Fixed:
1. 406 (Not Acceptable) errors when querying:
   - gap_analysis_results
   - streamlined_assessment_responses 
   - institution_memberships
   
2. Added missing /api/assessment/check endpoint

3. Document upload not completing due to database errors

Root Cause:
- Using .single() on queries that might return 0 rows
- Supabase returns 406 when expecting exactly 1 row but getting 0 or multiple

Solution:
- Replaced .single() with .maybeSingle() in:
  - app/dashboard/personalized/page.tsx
  - app/assessment/upload-documents/page.tsx
  - lib/hooks/useUserContext.ts
  - app/api/assessment/check/route.ts (new)

This allows proper handling when users don't have data yet.
