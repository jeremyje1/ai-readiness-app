4. Update external collateral (pitch decks, docs) to use canonical URLs
5. Submit updated sitemap at `/sitemap.xml` in Search Console
6. Set URL removal (temporary) if old higher-ed pages were indexed separately

## 🎨 **Brand Consistency**

Both pages maintain:
- ✅ Same visual design and styling
- ✅ Same patent-pending algorithm suite information
- ✅ Same pricing structure ($995/month)
- ✅ Same 7-day free trial offer
- ✅ Same technical capabilities and features

**Differentiated by:**
- 🎯 Target audience language and terminology
- 🎯 Specific use cases and examples
- 🎯 Compliance and regulatory focus
- 🎯 Professional development approaches
- 🎯 Implementation strategies

## 📈 **Business Impact (After Consolidation)**

- ✅ Unified domain authority & backlink consolidation
- ✅ Reduced operational overhead (no dual certs / env / host logic)
- ✅ Lower risk of domain drift in auth & checkout URLs
- ✅ Simpler analytics & attribution
- ✅ Consistent security headers & HSTS scope

Higher Ed messaging remains accessible at a canonical path without maintaining a separate host.
