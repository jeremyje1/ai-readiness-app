CRITICAL ISSUE FIXED:
---------------------
Users have been stuck at the /welcome page for weeks. This deployment fixes the infinite loop.

CHANGES MADE:
1. Modified welcome page to create profile if missing after retries
2. Added "Skip Tour" button for immediate dashboard access  
3. Ensured profile creation with fallback data prevents loops
4. Fixed profile loading logic to avoid infinite retries

FILES MODIFIED:
- app/welcome/page.tsx

DEPLOYMENT URGENCY: CRITICAL
This has been blocking users for weeks and needs immediate deployment.

TESTING NOTES:
1. After deployment, test signup flow completely
2. Verify users can progress from welcome to dashboard
3. Check that profile is created properly
4. Ensure Skip Tour button works
