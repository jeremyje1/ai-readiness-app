# Payment Flow Clarification

## Current Implementation (as of October 1, 2025)

### User Journey:
1. **Login** → Redirects to `/auth/success`
2. **Success Page** → Offers two options:
   - Take AI Readiness Assessment (FREE)
   - View Pricing & Subscribe
3. **Dashboard Access** → Requires active subscription

### Payment Gates:

#### ✅ Requires Payment:
- `/ai-readiness/dashboard` - Main dashboard
- Executive dashboard features
- AI governance tools
- Policy generation
- Community features
- Expert sessions

#### ❌ Free Access (Currently):
- `/ai-readiness/assessment` - AI Readiness Assessment
- `/auth/success` - Post-login landing page
- `/pricing` - Pricing information

## Business Model Options:

### Option 1: Assessment as Lead Generation (Current)
- Free assessment to capture leads
- Payment required for dashboard and results
- Users can see their score but need subscription for detailed insights

### Option 2: Full Payment Gate
- Payment required immediately after login
- No free features except marketing pages
- Redirect to pricing/checkout instead of success page

### Option 3: Freemium Model
- Basic assessment free
- Advanced features require payment
- Limited dashboard access for free users

## Recommended Approach:

If you want to require payment for all features:

1. **Change login redirect** from `/auth/success` to `/pricing`
2. **Add payment check** to assessment page
3. **Update success page** to only show after successful payment
4. **Create checkout flow** that leads to dashboard access

Would you like me to implement one of these approaches? Please clarify:
- Should the assessment require payment?
- Should users go directly to pricing after login?
- What should happen to users who login but haven't paid yet?
