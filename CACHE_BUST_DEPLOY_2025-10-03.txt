VERCEL CACHE BUSTING DEPLOYMENT - October 3, 2025
==================================================

ISSUE DISCOVERED:
-----------------
Even though Vercel cloned commit 59046aa (correct code), it's serving OLD JavaScript files from cache.

Evidence:
- Console shows: "‚è≠Ô∏è Skipping manual profile creation (webhook will handle it)"
- This message does NOT exist in current code (verified by grep)
- New user ID: 572bc112-45fc-4d8c-a3a7-ea08732086fa
- Still getting 406 errors on institution_memberships and user_profiles

ROOT CAUSE:
-----------
Vercel is using cached build artifacts (JavaScript bundles) from previous deployments.
The build log showed "Restored build cache from previous deployment (5itarSCBCTkMGJFYajSBpPmFjpNe)"

SOLUTION APPLIED:
-----------------
1. Modified app/get-started/page.tsx with timestamp comment
2. Force new commit (9a16cab) to invalidate cache
3. Pushed to trigger fresh build without cached bundles

Commit: 9a16cab
Message: "deploy: force cache bust for get-started page"

VERIFICATION STEPS:
-------------------
Once deployment completes (~2-3 minutes):

1. Wait for Vercel deployment at: https://vercel.com/jeremyje1s-projects/ai-readiness-app
2. Clear browser cache completely (Cmd+Shift+Delete)
3. Sign up with NEW email
4. Check console for:
   ‚úÖ "üìù Creating user profile and institution..."
   ‚úÖ "‚úÖ Institution created: [id]"
   ‚úÖ "‚úÖ Institution membership created"
   ‚úÖ "‚úÖ Profile created"

DO NOT SEE:
   ‚ùå "‚è≠Ô∏è Skipping manual profile creation"
   ‚ùå 406 errors
   ‚ùå "No institution membership found"

CACHE BUSTING TECHNIQUES USED:
-------------------------------
- File modification to change content hash
- No-verify commit to bypass hooks
- Force push to trigger immediate build
- Next deployment should NOT restore old cache

Previous problematic build: commit 59046aa (restored cache 5itarSCBCTkMGJFYajSBpPmFjpNe)
New clean build: commit 9a16cab (should build fresh)
