2. Copy contents of `supabase/migrations/20251017_create_demo_leads_table.sql`
3. Paste into SQL Editor
4. Click "Run"
5. Verify table created: `SELECT * FROM demo_leads LIMIT 1;`

**Option B - Supabase CLI**:
```bash
npx supabase db push --linked
```

### Step 2: Deploy Frontend Changes

```bash
# Commit all changes
git add .

## 📈 Success Metrics to Track

### Conversion Funnel
1. **Visitors**: Page views on `/ai-readiness-demo`
2. **Form Starts**: Lead form submissions
3. **Completions**: Assessments with all 12 responses
4. **Demos Scheduled**: Calendly bookings within 7 days
5. **Customers**: Subscriptions within 30 days

### Target KPIs (from implementation plan)
- Completion rate: 80%+
- Average time: <15 minutes
- Demo booking rate: 10-12% of completions
- Customer conversion: 3-5% of demos

### Database Queries for Reporting

```sql
-- Daily completions
SELECT 
  DATE(completed_at) as date,
  COUNT(*) as completions,
  AVG(overall_score) as avg_score,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE lead_qualification = 'HOT') as hot_leads
FROM demo_leads
WHERE completed_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY DATE(completed_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;

-- Lead qualification breakdown
SELECT 
  lead_qualification,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  AVG(overall_score) as avg_score,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE contacted = true) as contacted,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE demo_scheduled = true) as demos_scheduled
FROM demo_leads
WHERE completed_at IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY lead_qualification;

-- Top performing UTM sources
SELECT 
  utm_source,
  utm_campaign,
  COUNT(*) as leads,
  AVG(overall_score) as avg_score,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE demo_scheduled = true) as demos
FROM demo_leads
WHERE completed_at IS NOT NULL
  AND utm_source IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY utm_source, utm_campaign
ORDER BY demos DESC, leads DESC;
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: API returns 500 error
**Solution**: Check Supabase connection
```bash
# Verify environment variables
npx vercel env ls

# Test Supabase connection
curl -X GET "https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co/rest/v1/demo_leads?limit=1" \
  -H "apikey: YOUR_ANON_KEY"
```

### Issue: Emails not sending
**Solution**: Check SendGrid API key and logs
```bash
# Verify SendGrid key
curl -X GET "https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/user/profile" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SENDGRID_API_KEY"

# Check Vercel function logs
vercel logs --follow
```

### Issue: CORS errors on demo page
**Solution**: All API routes include CORS headers. Verify in Network tab:
- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, OPTIONS`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type`

### Issue: Demo page blank in WordPress iframe
**Solution**: Check iframe src attribute and CSP headers
```html
<!-- Ensure HTTPS -->
<iframe src="https://aiblueprint.educationaiblueprint.com/education-ai-blueprint-demo.html">
```
