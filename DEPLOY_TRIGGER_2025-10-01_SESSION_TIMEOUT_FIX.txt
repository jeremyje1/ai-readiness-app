SESSION TIMEOUT FIX - DEPLOYMENT TRIGGER
Deployed: October 1, 2025
Commit: 72b9c08

CHANGES:
1. Extended JWT expiry from 1 hour to 24 hours (supabase/config.toml)
2. Added proactive session refresh in dashboard (< 5 min to expiry)
3. Added TOKEN_REFRESHED event listener for automatic re-authentication
4. Prevents "session expired" errors during active use

CRITICAL POST-DEPLOYMENT ACTION REQUIRED:
⚠️  You MUST update Supabase Dashboard settings manually:
    1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/[YOUR_PROJECT]/settings/auth
    2. Find: JWT Settings → JWT expiry time
    3. Change from: 3600 seconds → 86400 seconds (24 hours)
    4. Click: Save

    The config.toml change only affects LOCAL development.
    Production JWT expiry is controlled in Supabase Dashboard.

TESTING AFTER DEPLOYMENT:
1. Wait for Vercel deployment to complete (2-3 minutes)
2. Update Supabase Dashboard JWT expiry setting (see above)
3. Log in to production site
4. Check browser DevTools → Application → Local Storage → supabase.auth.token
5. Verify expires_at is ~24 hours from now (not 1 hour)
6. Click email address in top right - should work smoothly
7. Console should show "[Dashboard] Session token refreshed" logs

FIXES ISSUE:
- User reported "Verifying access checking your payment status" hanging
- Console showed "session expired" errors during active sessions
- Sessions were expiring after 1 hour, interrupting workflows

VERCEL DEPLOYMENT:
- Auto-deployment triggered by Git push
- Expected completion: ~2-3 minutes from push time
- Check: https://vercel.com/[your-account]/[your-project]/deployments
