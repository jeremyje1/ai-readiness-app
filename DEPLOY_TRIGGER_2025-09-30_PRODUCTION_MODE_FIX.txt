DEPLOYMENT TRIGGER - Production Mode Debug Logging Fix
=====================================================
Date: 2025-09-30
Time: 11:08 AM PST
Commit: 6b64dc5

ISSUE FIXED:
-----------
- Application showing duplicate debug logs in production
- Auth service logging too verbose in production environment
- Debug mode being enabled when it shouldn't be

CHANGES DEPLOYED:
-----------------

1. Updated lib/supabase.ts:
   - Changed debug logic from OR to AND condition
   - Now requires NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_DEBUG='1' AND not production
   - Prevents debug mode in production even if NODE_ENV is misconfigured

2. Updated lib/auth-service.ts:
   - Debug logging now defaults to development mode only
   - Removed duplicate console.log statements
   - Fixed initialization logging to only log once

DEPLOYMENT STATUS:
------------------
- Git Push: âœ“ Successful
- Commit Hash: 6b64dc5
- Branch: main
- Vercel should auto-deploy from this push

VERIFICATION STEPS:
-------------------
1. After deployment, check browser console
2. Should see minimal logs in production
3. Auth service should only initialize once
4. No duplicate "[Auth Service]" messages

ACTION ITEMS FOR VERCEL:
------------------------
1. Check Vercel environment variables:
   - Remove or set NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_DEBUG=0
   - NODE_ENV should be automatically set to 'production'
   
2. If still seeing debug logs after deployment:
   - Clear Vercel build cache
   - Redeploy with clean build

NOTES:
------
- NODE_ENV is automatically set to 'production' by Vercel
- Debug logging should now be disabled in production
- This will reduce console noise and improve performance
