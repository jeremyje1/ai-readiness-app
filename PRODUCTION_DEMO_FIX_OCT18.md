## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Steps:

   ```
   Expected:

   ```
   Expected:
   - [ ] Dashboard loads immediately (no redirect to /demo)
   - [ ] User session persists
   - [ ] All features accessible

4. **Check Server Logs**
   In Vercel Functions logs, look for:
   ```
   üîê Attempting demo login for: demo@educationaiblueprint.com
   üîê Sign in result: { success: true, userId: '...' }
   ‚úÖ Demo session created successfully
   üöÄ Demo login complete, redirecting to: /dashboard/personalized?demo=true&tour=start
   ```

5. **Verify Cookies**

   - [ ] All "Try Free Demo" buttons point to `/demo`
   - [ ] Clicking demo button loads demo flow
   - [ ] No 404 errors

## üîç Known Issues to Monitor

### 1. Demo User Must Exist in Supabase
**Problem:** If demo user doesn't exist, login will fail
**Symptom:** Error message "Failed to create demo user"
**Fix:** Ensure demo user exists in Supabase auth.users:
```sql
-- Check if exists
SELECT id, email FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'demo@educationaiblueprint.com';

-- If not, create via Supabase Dashboard or:
-- https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/[project-id]/auth/users
```

### 2. Missing Demo Organization/Profile
**Problem:** Demo user exists but no org/profile records
**Symptom:** Dashboard loads but RLS blocks data access
**Fix:** The API route now attempts to create these automatically, but verify:
```sql
SELECT * FROM organizations WHERE name = 'Demo Education District';
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'demo@educationaiblueprint.com';
```

### 3. RLS Policies
**Problem:** Demo user can't read/write data
**Symptom:** Dashboard shows empty state or errors
**Fix:** Verify RLS policies allow demo user access

## üìä Success Metrics

After deployment, monitor:
- [ ] Zero "üîê No session" console errors
- [ ] Zero infinite redirect loops
- [ ] `/api/demo/login` success rate > 95%
- [ ] Average demo session duration
- [ ] Conversion rate from demo to signup

## üö® Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git revert 1d1d3c1

# Redeploy
vercel --prod
```

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Monitor Production Logs**
   - Check Vercel Functions logs for demo login attempts
   - Look for any auth errors
   - Verify no redirect loops

2. **User Feedback**
   - Monitor support requests about demo
   - Check analytics for demo bounce rate
   - Gather feedback on demo experience

3. **Supabase Verification**
   - [ ] Confirm demo user exists
   - [ ] Verify demo organization/profile
   - [ ] Check RLS policies

4. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Update main README with demo URL
   - [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for demo issues
   - [ ] Document Supabase setup requirements
