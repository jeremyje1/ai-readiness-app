DEPLOYMENT TRIGGER - Chrome Login Fix
====================================
Date: October 1, 2025
Time: 17:30 UTC

CHANGES MADE:
1. Enhanced Chrome browser detection and workaround
   - Added hardcoded Supabase URL fallback for env var issues
   - Implemented 10-second timeout with AbortController
   - Added detailed request/response logging
   
2. Improved error handling
   - Chrome-specific error messages
   - Better handling of invalid credentials
   - Timeout-specific guidance to use other browsers
   
3. User experience improvements
   - Clear messages when Chrome has issues
   - Suggestions to use Safari/Firefox/Edge
   - Preserved "Forgot password?" link

FILES MODIFIED:
- app/auth/login/page.tsx

TESTING STATUS:
✅ Code compiles without errors
✅ Chrome workaround implemented
✅ Timeout protection added
❌ Chrome login still timing out (network level issue)

KNOWN ISSUES:
- Chrome appears to be blocking the authentication request at the network level
- This may be due to CORS, security policies, or Chrome-specific restrictions
- Workaround: Users should use Safari, Firefox, or Edge browsers

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
1. Deploy these changes to provide better error messages
2. Consider implementing magic link authentication as Chrome fallback
3. Investigate CORS configuration on Supabase side
4. Add browser compatibility notice on login page

DEPLOYMENT READY: YES (improves UX even if Chrome issue persists)
