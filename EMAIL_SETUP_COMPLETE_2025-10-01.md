# ‚úÖ Email System Setup Complete - October 1, 2025

## Summary
All email delivery issues have been resolved and the system is now fully configured in production.

---

## üéØ Issues Fixed

### 1. MessageStream Configuration ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Code was using default `'outbound'` MessageStream which doesn't exist in Postmark
**Solution:** Changed default to `'aiblueprint-transactional'` in `lib/email-service.ts` (line 67)
**Impact:** All customer emails will now be delivered successfully

### 2. Missing Admin Notifications ‚úÖ
**Problem:** No email sent to admin when new customers complete payment
**Solution:** 
- Added `sendNewCustomerNotification()` method to EmailService
- Modified Stripe webhook to call admin notification after customer email
- Includes customer details, tier, Stripe IDs, and dashboard links
**Impact:** Admin will now receive instant notifications for new customer signups

   - Check stream is active and not paused

2. **Verify Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   vercel env ls production | grep POSTMARK

   ```

3. **Check Vercel Function Logs**
   - Look for error messages in webhook function
   - Verify email service initialization

4. **Test Postmark API Directly**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://api.postmarkapp.com/email" \
     -H "Accept: application/json" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "X-Postmark-Server-Token: 455001d4-2657-4b12-bfc7-66c63734daf8" \
