FIX SUMMARY:
------------
Fixed 406 errors on welcome page caused by missing institution membership for new users.

ERROR OBSERVED:
- "No institution membership found for user"
- 406 Not Acceptable errors when loading profile
- Welcome page stuck in retry loop

ROOT CAUSE:
The system expects all users to have an institution membership, but new signups
don't have one created automatically.

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
1. Welcome page now checks for existing institution membership
2. If none exists, automatically creates:
   - A new institution based on user's email domain or metadata
   - An institution membership with admin role
3. Then creates the user profile with all required fields

CHANGES MADE:
- app/welcome/page.tsx - Added institution and membership creation logic

USER FLOW:
1. User signs up
2. Redirected to welcome page
3. System creates institution & membership if needed
4. Profile is created
5. User can continue to tour or skip to dashboard

TESTING NOTES:
1. Sign up with a new account
2. Verify no 406 errors on welcome page
3. Check that institution is created in database
4. Verify user can progress past welcome page

ALL FIXES IN THIS DEPLOYMENT:
1. Welcome page infinite loop fix
2. Build failures fixed (OpenAI & Stripe)  
3. Assessment flow fixed with document upload
4. Institution membership auto-creation
