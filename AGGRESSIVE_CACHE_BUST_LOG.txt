AGGRESSIVE CACHE BUSTING DEPLOYMENT
====================================
Date: October 3, 2025 - 13:45 CST
Commit: c0d55f7

PROBLEM:
--------
Vercel keeps serving OLD cached JavaScript bundles even after:
1. Commit 59046aa - restored cache from previous build
2. Commit 9a16cab - file modification attempt
3. STILL showing "‚è≠Ô∏è Skipping manual profile creation" (code that doesn't exist!)

JavaScript bundle names in browser:
- page-67ce153a3c115125.js (get-started page - OLD CODE!)
- page-64f6c745fed2da72.js (welcome page)
- layout-51321fa5bfdb8aa6.js (layout)

AGGRESSIVE SOLUTIONS APPLIED:
------------------------------

1. ‚úÖ Added Unique Console Log Marker
   - Added: "üî• CACHE BUST v2 - October 3, 2025 13:45 CST"
   - This will ONLY appear if new code is deployed
   - Easy visual verification in browser console

2. ‚úÖ Created vercel.json Config
   - Forces Next.js to use commit SHA as build ID
   - Should prevent build cache reuse
   - Each deployment gets unique build hash

3. ‚úÖ Deleted Local .next Cache
   - Ensures clean local state

4. ‚úÖ Committed ALL Files
   - Including fix-existing-user.js script
   - Including cache bust documentation

VERIFICATION STEPS:
-------------------
1. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment
2. Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R) or clear cache completely
3. Sign up with NEW email
4. Look for this EXACT message in console:
   
   üî• CACHE BUST v2 - October 3, 2025 13:45 CST
   
5. If you see this message, the new code is running
6. If you DON'T see it, Vercel cache is still active

EXPECTED CONSOLE OUTPUT (NEW CODE):
------------------------------------
‚úÖ Session created automatically
üî• CACHE BUST v2 - October 3, 2025 13:45 CST  ‚Üê NEW!
üìù Creating user profile and institution...
‚úÖ Institution created: [id]
‚úÖ Institution membership created
‚úÖ Profile created

BAD CONSOLE OUTPUT (OLD CACHED CODE):
--------------------------------------
‚úÖ Session created automatically
‚è≠Ô∏è Skipping manual profile creation (webhook will handle it)  ‚Üê OLD!
üìß Sending welcome email...

NEXT STEPS IF STILL FAILING:
-----------------------------
If you STILL see old code after this:
1. The issue is Vercel's CDN/edge cache
2. We may need to:
   - Contact Vercel support
   - Delete and redeploy the project
   - Use a different deployment branch
   - Manually invalidate Vercel's cache

BUILD HASHES TO VERIFY:
-----------------------
Current deployed bundles (OLD):
- page-67ce153a3c115125.js

After deployment, these should CHANGE to new hashes like:
- page-[NEW-HASH].js

If the hash is SAME after deployment, cache is still being used.
