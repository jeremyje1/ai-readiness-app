CRITICAL FIXES IN THIS DEPLOYMENT:
=================================

1. Fixed Multiple GoTrueClient Instances Warning
   - Updated useUserContext.ts to use createClient() from @/lib/supabase/client
   - Updated useInstitutionSetup.ts to use createClient() from @/lib/supabase/client

2. Fixed 406 Errors on institution_memberships 
   - Root cause: wrong Supabase client wasn't sending auth headers
   - Fixed by updating to browser-specific client

3. Fixed Assessment Redirect Loop
   - Removed redirect logic in upload-documents page that was sending users back
   - Now allows access even if assessment query fails

4. Fixed 500 Error on Email Endpoint
   - Made email sending non-blocking (fire-and-forget)
   - Added comprehensive error handling to prevent failures from blocking flow

5. Should Fix 406 on streamlined_assessment_responses
   - Same root cause as institution_memberships (wrong client)

COMMITS INCLUDED:
- 8e3a665: improve email error handling
- 05f1495: update client-side hooks to use proper browser Supabase client
- 76772c4: remove redirect loop from upload-documents page
