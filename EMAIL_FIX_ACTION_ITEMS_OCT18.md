# Email Sending Issue - Action Items

## üö® Issue Summary

**Problem**: Emails are NOT being sent after demo assessment completion
- ‚ùå User results email not delivered to potential clients
- ‚ùå Sales notification email not delivered to admin/sales team

**Root Cause**: Most likely **SENDGRID_API_KEY not set in Vercel production environment** or the API key is invalid/expired.

---

## ‚úÖ What I've Done

### 1. Diagnosed the Issue

Analyzed the codebase and found:
- ‚úÖ Email sending code is **correctly implemented** (uses SendGrid API directly, not webhook)
- ‚úÖ API key sanitization is **already in place**
- ‚úÖ Error handling exists but errors are **silently swallowed** (by design, to not block assessment submission)
- ‚ùå Likely issue: **Environment variable missing or invalid**

### 2. Created Diagnostic Tools

**Created**:
- `/api/test/sendgrid` - Test endpoint to validate SendGrid configuration
- `EMAIL_SENDING_DEBUG_OCT18.md` - Comprehensive debugging guide

**What the test endpoint does**:
- Checks if `SENDGRID_API_KEY` is set
- Sends a real test email via SendGrid
- Returns detailed diagnostic information
- Helps identify exact error (missing key, invalid key, auth failure, etc.)

### 3. Committed & Deployed

- Commit: `89beb8f`
- Pushed to GitHub
- Vercel auto-deployment in progress

## üéØ Immediate Actions Required (Your Task)

### Step 1: Test SendGrid Configuration

Once Vercel deployment completes (~2 minutes), visit:

**Test URL**: https://aiblueprint.educationaiblueprint.com/api/test/sendgrid

**Expected outcomes**:

‚úÖ **If it works**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Test email sent successfully! Check your inbox.",
  "debug": {
    "apiKeyPresent": true,
    "apiKeyLength": 69,
    "fromEmail": "info@northpathstrategies.org",
    "toEmail": "info@northpathstrategies.org"
  }
}
```
‚Üí **Action**: Check inbox for test email. If received, the problem is elsewhere (check Step 3).

‚ùå **If it fails with missing API key**:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "SENDGRID_API_KEY environment variable is not set",
  "debug": {
    "apiKeyPresent": false
  }
}
```
‚Üí **Action**: Go to Step 2 - Add API key to Vercel

‚ùå **If it fails with SendGrid error**:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "SendGrid API returned an error",
  "debug": {
    "status": 401,
    "errorBody": "Unauthorized"
  }
}
```
‚Üí **Action**: API key is invalid or expired. Generate new key (Step 2).

### Step 2: Add/Update SendGrid API Key in Vercel

**Go to**: https://vercel.com/jeremys-projects-73929cad/ai-readiness/settings/environment-variables

#### 2A. Check Existing Variables

Look for these three variables:
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY`
- `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL`
- `SENDGRID_TO_EMAIL`

#### 2B. If Missing or Invalid, Add/Update:

1. **Get SendGrid API Key**:
   - Go to: https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys
   - Click "Create API Key"
   - Name: `Education AI Blueprint - Production`
   - Permissions: **Full Access** (or minimum: **Mail Send**)
   - Copy the key: `SG.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

2. **Add to Vercel**:
   - Click "Add Environment Variable"
   - Name: `SENDGRID_API_KEY`
   - Value: `SG.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` (paste the key)
   - Environment: Check **Production**, **Preview**, **Development**
   - Click "Save"

3. **Add other variables** (if missing):
   ```
   SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=info@northpathstrategies.org
   SENDGRID_TO_EMAIL=info@northpathstrategies.org
   ```

4. **Redeploy**:
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/jeremys-projects-73929cad/ai-readiness/deployments
   - Click "..." next to latest deployment ‚Üí "Redeploy"
   - Wait ~2 minutes for deployment

5. **Retest**: Visit test endpoint again (Step 1)

---

### Step 3: Check Production Logs (If Test Endpoint Works)

If the test endpoint successfully sends email but demo assessments still don't send emails:

**Go to**: https://vercel.com/jeremys-projects-73929cad/ai-readiness/logs

**Filter for**:
- `/api/demo/emails/user-results`
- `/api/demo/emails/sales-notification`
- `SendGrid`

**Look for error messages**:
```
‚ùå "Failed to send user results email"
‚ùå "Failed to send sales notification email"
‚ùå "SendGrid error: ..."
```

**If you see errors**, check the `EMAIL_SENDING_DEBUG_OCT18.md` document for detailed troubleshooting steps.

---

### Step 4: Test Complete Demo Flow

Once SendGrid is configured:

1. **Go to**: https://aiblueprint.educationaiblueprint.com/demo
2. **Complete the intake form** with your email
3. **Complete the assessment** (answer all 12 questions)
4. **Submit assessment**
5. **Check your inbox** for:
   - ‚úÖ User results email with your score and recommendations
6. **Check admin inbox** (info@northpathstrategies.org) for:
   - ‚úÖ Sales notification email with lead details
