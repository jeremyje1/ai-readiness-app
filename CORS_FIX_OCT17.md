# CORS Fix - October 17, 2025

## Problem
The lead generation form was failing with CORS errors when submitting from `https://educationaiblueprint.com` to the API endpoint at `https://aiblueprint.educationaiblueprint.com/api/webhooks/sendgrid`.

### Error Messages
```
Access to fetch at 'https://aiblueprint.educationaiblueprint.com/api/webhooks/sendgrid' 
from origin 'https://educationaiblueprint.com' has been blocked by CORS policy: 
No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

### Additional Issues
- API was receiving `undefined` values for all fields
- Multiple 400 Bad Request responses showing: `name: 'undefined undefined', email: undefined`

## Root Cause
The SendGrid webhook API endpoint (`/app/api/webhooks/sendgrid/route.ts`) had CORS headers in the OPTIONS handler but **not in the POST response or error responses**.

## Solution Implemented

### Added CORS Headers to All Responses
Updated all response types in `/app/api/webhooks/sendgrid/route.ts`:

1. **Success Response** (200)
2. **Error Responses** (400, 500)
3. **All validation error responses**

### CORS Headers Added
```typescript
headers: {
    'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
    'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'POST, OPTIONS',
    'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type',
}
```

### Files Modified
- `app/api/webhooks/sendgrid/route.ts` - Added CORS headers to 5 response locations

## Testing

### Before Fix
- ‚ùå CORS policy blocked requests
- ‚ùå Form showed: "Sorry, there was an error sending your message"
- ‚ùå Console showed: `TypeError: Failed to fetch`
- ‚ùå Server logs showed: `name: 'undefined undefined', email: undefined`

### After Fix
- ‚úÖ CORS headers present in all responses
- ‚úÖ Form submissions should complete successfully
- ‚úÖ No browser CORS errors
- ‚úÖ Email delivery to info@northpathstrategies.org

## Deployment

**Commit**: `4d53b62` - "fix: add CORS headers to all SendGrid API responses"

**Production URL**: https://ai-readiness-1y3qb2nth-jeremys-projects-73929cad.vercel.app

**API Endpoint**: https://aiblueprint.educationaiblueprint.com/api/webhooks/sendgrid

## Next Steps

1. **Test the form** on the production site:
   - Visit: https://educationaiblueprint.com/[your-lead-gen-page-url]
   - Fill out and submit the form
   - Verify success message appears
   - Check inbox at info@northpathstrategies.org for lead notification email
   - Check form submitter's inbox for confirmation email

2. **Monitor Vercel logs**:
   ```bash
   vercel logs --follow
   ```

3. **Check for any remaining issues**:
   - Browser console should show: `üì§ Sending to SendGrid webhook`
   - Should show: `üì• Response status: 200`
   - Should show: `Response data: { success: true, message: "Form submitted successfully" }`

## Technical Details

### CORS Flow
1. Browser sends OPTIONS preflight request ‚Üí Returns CORS headers ‚úÖ
2. Browser sends POST request with form data ‚Üí Returns CORS headers ‚úÖ
3. Browser reads response and displays success message ‚úÖ

### SendGrid Integration
- Form submits to Next.js API route
- API validates data and formats email
- Sends via SendGrid API v3
- Sends confirmation email to user
- Returns JSON response with CORS headers

## Notes
- The CORS policy is currently set to `*` (allow all origins) for maximum compatibility
- For production, consider restricting to specific domains:
  ```typescript
  'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': 'https://educationaiblueprint.com'
  ```
- All email delivery goes through SendGrid (API key configured in Vercel environment)
