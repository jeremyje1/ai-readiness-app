# Platform Audit Results - October 1, 2025

## Executive Summary

Tested the platform using jeremy.estrella@gmail.com credentials and confirmed several issues identified in the external audit. The platform has significant gaps between marketing promises and actual functionality.

## Key Findings

### 1. ✅ CONFIRMED: Not Using Real User Data
**Test Results:**
- User has institution "H Town College" set up
- Assessment was submitting with hardcoded "Educational Institution"
- No connection between user's actual institution and assessment data
- **STATUS: FIXED** - Assessment now fetches and uses real institution data

### 2. ✅ CONFIRMED: No Assessments Saved
**Test Results:**
- User has 0 assessments in database despite being active
- Assessment data not being properly persisted
- Results page falls back to "Sample Institution" mock data

### 3. ⚠️ PARTIAL: Institution Setup Works (Sometimes)
**Test Results:**
- User has "H Town College" successfully created
- Modal hanging issue not reproduced in test
- But audit shows it fails for new users

### 4. ❌ MISSING: Payment Integration
**Test Results:**
- No payment records found for user
- Dashboard shows "Payment Verified" but no backend data
- Free trial logic not implemented

### 5. ✅ WORKING: Core Features
**Test Results:**
- Authentication working (except Chrome issues)
- Institution memberships functional
- Database queries working
- Expert Sessions links to Calendly

## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Fix

### 1. Assessment Data Persistence
- Assessments submit but don't save to database
- Need to fix /api/ai-readiness/submit endpoint
- Remove all mock data fallbacks

### 2. Institution Creation Error Handling
```javascript
// Current: No error feedback
const { data, error } = await supabase.from('institutions').insert(...)
if (error) throw error; // User sees nothing

// Fix: Add proper error handling
if (error) {
  if (error.code === '23505') { // Duplicate
    setError('An institution with this name already exists');
  } else {
    setError('Failed to create institution. Please try again.');
  }
  return null;
}
```

### 3. Chrome Browser Compatibility
- getSession() hangs in Chrome (both regular and incognito)
- Direct API workaround partially implemented
- Needs comprehensive fix across all auth flows

### 4. Marketing Alignment Gaps
- Interactive demo exists at /assessment-2-demo but not linked
- Board calendar automation not implemented
- Policy update notifications not visible
- Slack community requires manual email

## Recommendations

### Phase 1: Data Integrity (Week 1)
1. Fix assessment submission to save real data
2. Add error handling to institution creation
3. Remove all mock/demo data fallbacks
4. Implement proper empty states

### Phase 2: Feature Completion (Week 2)
1. Link interactive demo from homepage
2. Implement board calendar export
3. Create policy update dashboard
4. Automate Slack invitations

### Phase 3: User Experience (Week 3)
1. Add loading states and progress indicators
2. Implement sector toggle (K-12 vs Higher Ed)
3. Fix all 404 pages
4. Add comprehensive error messages

## Database Schema Issues

Found missing tables referenced in code:
- `user_profiles` - Not created but referenced
- `ai_readiness_results` - Exists and working
- `ai_readiness_assessments` - Exists but not saving data

## Quick Wins Implemented

✅ Assessment now uses real user institution data
- Fetches from institution_memberships
- Uses actual institution name and type
- Properly associates with user ID

## Next Steps

1. Deploy assessment fix
2. Debug why assessments aren't saving to database
3. Add error handling to institution modal
4. Create user profile table or remove references
5. Implement missing marketing features
