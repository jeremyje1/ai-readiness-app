CACHE BUSTING ATTEMPT #2

The JavaScript bundles are STILL showing old versions:
- page-58caea26a80c1ad1.js (OLD - should have changed)
- layout-3548995badf52c15.js (OLD - should have changed)

Despite multiple deployments, Vercel is serving cached bundles.

This file forces a new deployment to bust the cache.

CRITICAL FIXES WAITING TO DEPLOY:
- Fixed Multiple GoTrueClient instances warning
- Fixed 406 errors on all Supabase queries
- Fixed assessment redirect loop
- Fixed document count display
- Fixed email error handling
