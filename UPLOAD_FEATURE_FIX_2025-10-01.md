# ✅ Upload Feature Fix - October 1, 2025

## Issue
**Question 28 of the AI Readiness Assessment** was missing the upload interface. The question "Upload your faculty AI training materials or guidelines (if available)" displayed only the help text with no way for users to upload files.

---

## Root Cause
The assessment page (`app/ai-readiness/assessment/page.tsx`) was missing rendering logic for questions with `type: 'upload'`. It only handled:
- `scale_with_context` - Rating scale questions with context textarea
- `open_ended` - Free-form text response questions

The question data in `lib/ai-readiness-questions.ts` was correctly defined as `type: "upload"`, but the UI had no case to handle it.

---

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated TypeScript Type Definition
**File:** `app/ai-readiness/assessment/page.tsx` (line 19)

**Before:**
```typescript
type: 'scale_with_context' | 'open_ended';
```

**After:**
```typescript
type: 'scale_with_context' | 'open_ended' | 'upload';
```

### 2. Added Upload UI Component
**File:** `app/ai-readiness/assessment/page.tsx` (lines 656-711)

Added comprehensive upload interface with:

#### **Drag-and-Drop Zone**
- Dashed border file drop area
- Upload icon (📄)
- Visual hover feedback
- Clear instructions

#### **File Browser Button**
- Accepts: `.pdf, .doc, .docx, .txt, .ppt, .pptx`
- Multiple file selection support
- Hidden native file input styled with custom button
- Blue primary button styling

#### **Upload Confirmation**
- Green checkmark when files uploaded
- Shows number of files and filenames
- "Clear" button to remove selection
- Green success styling

#### **Skip Option**
- "Skip - I don't have these materials yet" link
- Saves placeholder response
- Allows progression without files
- Blue link styling
