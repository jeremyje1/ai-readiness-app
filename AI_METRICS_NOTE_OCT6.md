# AI Readiness Metrics Update Note - October 6, 2025

## Current Situation
The blueprint you're viewing was generated before the AI readiness metrics update. It shows the legacy organizational metrics:
- DSCH (Digital Strategy & Capability) 
- LEI (Leadership Effectiveness)
- CRF (Change Readiness)
- OCI (Organizational Culture)
- HOCI (Operational Capability)

## New AI-Specific Metrics (AIRIX Framework)
New blueprints will use the updated AI-specific metrics:
- **AIRS** - AI Infrastructure & Resources Score
- **AICS** - AI Capability & Competence Score
- **AIMS** - AI Implementation Maturity Score
- **AIPS** - AI Policy & Ethics Score
- **AIBS** - AI Benefits Score
- **AIRIX** - Overall AI Readiness Index

## To Get Updated Metrics
1. Complete a new assessment
2. Generate a new blueprint
3. The new blueprint will automatically use the AI-specific metrics

## Why the Change?
The new AIRIX framework provides more relevant metrics specifically designed for AI readiness assessment, rather than generic organizational metrics. This gives you better insights into your institution's actual preparedness for AI implementation.

## Existing Blueprints
Existing blueprints will continue to display with the legacy metrics for consistency. The metrics shown (DSCH, LEI, CRF, OCI, HOCI) are still valid indicators of organizational readiness, but the new AI-specific metrics provide more targeted insights.
