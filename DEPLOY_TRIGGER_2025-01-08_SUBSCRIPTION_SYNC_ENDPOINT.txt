Deploy Trigger: Subscription Sync Endpoint
Time: 2025-01-08 10:45 UTC
Reason: Add manual subscription sync endpoint for existing users

Changes:
- Created app/api/stripe/sync-subscription/route.ts
- Endpoint searches Stripe for customer by email
- Updates user_payments table with correct subscription status
- Handles case where webhook didn't update existing users

Issue Fixed:
- User paid for premium but app didn't recognize subscription
- Webhook likely only handled new users, not existing ones
- Manual sync endpoint allows fixing subscription status

Next Steps:
1. Deploy this change
2. Call sync endpoint to fix user's subscription
3. Verify premium features are accessible
