# üîê Password Setup Authentication Guard

## Problem Solved

The issue was that users created via Stripe webhooks or other automated flows could authenticate and access the main application without setting up their passwords. This happened because:

1. **Users created via Stripe webhook** using `admin.createUser()` without passwords
2. **Password setup tokens** were generated but no logic enforced their use
3. **Users could authenticate** via magic links or other methods and bypass password setup entirely

## Solution Overview

Implemented a comprehensive authentication guard system that:

1. **Detects users who need password setup** by checking for unused password setup tokens
2. **Redirects users to password setup** before allowing access to protected pages  
3. **Preserves user journey** by returning them to their original destination after setup
4. **Works globally** across the entire application via layout integration

## Implementation Details

### 1. Password Setup Detection API
**File:** `/app/api/auth/password/check-required/route.ts`

- Checks if authenticated user has unused, non-expired password setup tokens
- Validates user metadata to identify users created without passwords
- Rate limited to prevent abuse
- Returns structured response indicating if password setup is required

### 2. Authentication Guard Component  
**File:** `/components/PasswordSetupGuard.tsx`

- Client-side component that wraps all application content
- Automatically checks password setup status for authenticated users
- Redirects to password setup page when needed
- Preserves original URL for return navigation
- Avoids infinite loops by excluding auth pages

### 3. Layout Integration
**File:** `/app/layout.tsx`

- Added `PasswordSetupGuard` to main layout
- Ensures the check runs on all protected pages
- Positioned after authentication providers for proper context

### 4. Enhanced Password Setup Page
**File:** `/app/auth/password/setup/page.tsx`

- Updated to handle `return_to` parameter
- Redirects users back to their original destination after password setup
- Falls back to login page with success message if no return URL

### 5. User Creation Updates
**Files:** `/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`, `/app/api/stripe/post-checkout/bootstrap/route.ts`

- Added `created_via` metadata to identify users created without passwords
- Ensures proper tracking of user creation method for authentication logic

## Usage Instructions

### For New Users (Stripe Flow)
1. **User completes Stripe checkout** ‚Üí User created via webhook without password
2. **User accesses any protected page** ‚Üí PasswordSetupGuard detects missing password
3. **User redirected to password setup** ‚Üí Must set password before continuing
4. **After password setup** ‚Üí User returned to original destination

### For Testing
```bash
# Create a test user without password
node test-password-guard.js test@example.com "Test User"

# The script will:
# 1. Create user with stripe_webhook metadata
# 2. Generate password setup token  
# 3. Provide testing instructions
```

### For Debugging
Check the password setup status for any user:
```bash
# Make authenticated request to:
GET /api/auth/password/check-required
Authorization: Bearer <user_access_token>

# Response includes:
{
  "needsPasswordSetup": boolean,
  "hasUnusedToken": boolean,
  "userEmail": string,
  "debug": {
    "tokenCount": number,
    "createdVia": string,
    "wasCreatedWithoutPassword": boolean
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

- **Rate limiting** on password check API (10 requests/minute per IP)
- **Token validation** ensures only valid, non-expired tokens trigger setup
- **User metadata verification** prevents false positives
- **Auth page exclusion** prevents redirect loops
- **Session validation** ensures only authenticated users can check status

## Backwards Compatibility

- **Existing users with passwords** are unaffected
- **Users created before tracking** are handled gracefully via metadata checks
- **Multiple creation methods** supported (webhook, checkout, manual, etc.)
- **Legacy user flows** continue to work normally

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] New user via Stripe webhook gets redirected to password setup
- [ ] Password setup redirects back to original destination  
- [ ] Users with passwords are not affected
- [ ] Auth pages don't trigger redirects
- [ ] API endpoints are rate limited and secure
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes
- [ ] No infinite redirect loops

## Files Modified

1. `/app/api/auth/password/check-required/route.ts` - New password detection API
2. `/components/PasswordSetupGuard.tsx` - New authentication guard component  
3. `/app/layout.tsx` - Integrated guard into main layout
4. `/app/auth/password/setup/page.tsx` - Enhanced with return URL handling
5. `/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts` - Added created_via metadata
6. `/app/api/stripe/post-checkout/bootstrap/route.ts` - Added created_via metadata
7. `/test-password-guard.js` - New testing utility

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy changes** to ensure the fix is active in production
2. **Monitor authentication flows** for any edge cases
3. **Test with real Stripe webhooks** to verify complete integration
4. **Consider email notifications** for users who need password setup
