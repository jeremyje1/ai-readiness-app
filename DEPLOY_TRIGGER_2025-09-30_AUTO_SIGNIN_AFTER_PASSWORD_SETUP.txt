DEPLOYMENT TRIGGER: Auto Sign-In After Password Setup Fix
Timestamp: 2025-09-30 15:15:00

CRITICAL FIX: Eliminates redundant login step after password setup in checkout flow

## Changes Made:

1. **app/auth/password/setup/page.tsx**
   - After successful password setup, automatically signs in the user
   - Uses authService.signInWithPassword() with the newly created credentials
   - Redirects to dashboard (or return_to URL) after successful auto-sign-in
   - Falls back to login page if auto-sign-in fails
   - Uses window.location.href for full page reload to ensure session cookies picked up

## Problem Solved:

**Before:**
- User completes Stripe checkout
- Gets email to set password
- Sets password on /auth/password/setup
- Redirected to /auth/login
- **Must manually enter credentials again** (redundant step)
- Login sometimes times out (15s timeout issue)

**After:**
- User completes Stripe checkout
- Gets email to set password  
- Sets password on /auth/password/setup
- **Automatically signed in with new password**
- **Directly redirected to dashboard** (no manual login needed)
- Full page reload ensures session cookies work properly

## User Experience Flow:

```
Stripe Checkout Success
    ‚Üì
Email with password setup link
    ‚Üì
Set password page (/auth/password/setup?token=...)
    ‚Üì
Enter new password (8+ chars)
    ‚Üì
API: POST /api/auth/password/setup (returns email)
    ‚Üì
Frontend: authService.signInWithPassword(email, password)
    ‚Üì
Success: window.location.href = '/ai-readiness/dashboard'
    ‚Üì
User is in the dashboard, fully authenticated ‚úÖ
```

## Fallback Handling:

If auto-sign-in fails for any reason:
- User sees "Password set! Please log in."
- Redirects to /auth/login?message=password-set
- User can manually sign in (still better than before)

## Technical Details:

- API already returns email in response: `{ success: true, email: data.email }`
- Dynamic import of authService to avoid circular dependencies
- 10-second timeout on password setup API call
- Full page reload with window.location.href ensures Supabase client picks up session
- Comprehensive error logging with üîê prefix for debugging

Deployment: Automatic via Vercel GitHub integration
Expected: 2-3 minutes for build and deployment
