## 📊 Database Queries for Monitoring

### Daily Completions
```sql
SELECT 
  DATE(completed_at) as date,
  COUNT(*) as completions,
  ROUND(AVG(overall_score), 1) as avg_score,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE lead_qualification = 'HOT') as hot_leads
FROM demo_leads
WHERE completed_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY DATE(completed_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

### Lead Qualification Breakdown
```sql
SELECT 
  lead_qualification,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  AVG(overall_score) as avg_score
FROM demo_leads
WHERE completed_at IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY lead_qualification;
```

### Conversion Funnel
```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE started_at IS NOT NULL) as started,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE completed_at IS NOT NULL) as completed,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE demo_scheduled = true) as demos_scheduled,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE converted_to_customer = true) as customers
