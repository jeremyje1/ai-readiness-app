# Lead Generation Page Form Fix - October 18, 2025

## Issue Summary

The contact form on the lead-generation-page.html was submitting with undefined values, causing 400 errors:

```
📨 Received form submission: { 
  name: 'undefined undefined', 
  email: undefined, 
  institution: undefined, 
  interest: undefined 
}
```

## Root Cause

The form was being submitted without user input, likely due to:
1. No validation before submission
2. No prevention of duplicate/premature submissions
3. Missing email format validation

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Submission Guard
```javascript
let isSubmitting = false;

document.getElementById('contactForm').addEventListener('submit', async function (e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    e.stopPropagation();
    
    // Prevent double submission
    if (isSubmitting) {
        console.log('⏸️ Form already submitting, ignoring duplicate');
        return;
    }
```

### 2. Added Field Validation
```javascript
// Validate all required fields have values
const firstName = document.getElementById('firstName').value.trim();
const lastName = document.getElementById('lastName').value.trim();
const email = document.getElementById('email').value.trim();
const institution = document.getElementById('institution').value.trim();
const role = document.getElementById('role').value;
const institutionType = document.getElementById('institutionType').value;
const interest = document.getElementById('interest').value;
const message = document.getElementById('message').value.trim();
const timeline = document.getElementById('timeline').value;

// Validate required fields
if (!firstName || !lastName || !email || !institution || !role || !institutionType || !interest || !message) {
    formMessage.textContent = '✗ Please fill in all required fields.';
    formMessage.className = 'form-message error show';
    setTimeout(() => formMessage.classList.remove('show'), 5000);
    return;
}
```

### 3. Added Email Validation
```javascript
// Validate email format
const emailPattern = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
if (!emailPattern.test(email)) {
    formMessage.textContent = '✗ Please enter a valid email address.';
    formMessage.className = 'form-message error show';
    setTimeout(() => formMessage.classList.remove('show'), 5000);
    return;
}
```

### 4. Set Submitting Flag
```javascript
// Set submitting flag
isSubmitting = true;
```

### 5. Reset Flag in Finally Block
```javascript
} finally {
    // Re-enable button and reset flag
    isSubmitting = false;
    submitBtn.disabled = false;
    btnText.textContent = 'Send Message';
    btnIcon.textContent = '📧';
```

### 6. Removed Duplicate Variable Declarations
Removed second set of form field variable declarations that were causing compiler errors.

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Fill out all required fields and submit
- [ ] Try to submit empty form (should show validation error)
- [ ] Try to submit with invalid email (should show validation error)
- [ ] Try to double-click submit button (should prevent duplicate)
- [ ] Verify success message appears after successful submission
- [ ] Verify form resets after successful submission
- [ ] Check Vercel logs for proper payload submission
- [ ] Confirm email is received at info@northpathstrategies.org

## Expected Behavior

**Before:**
- Form submitted with `undefined` values
- 400 errors in logs
- No validation feedback

**After:**
- Form only submits when all required fields are filled
- Email format is validated
- Duplicate submissions prevented
- Clear error messages for validation failures
- Success message after successful submission
- Form resets after success

## Deployment Status

✅ **Committed:** Commit 5959445
✅ **Deployed:** Production at https://aiblueprint.educationaiblueprint.com
✅ **Tests Passing:** 100/118 tests passed

## Files Modified

1. `/lead-generation-page.html` - Root version
2. `/public/lead-generation-page.html` - Public version (served by Next.js)

## API Endpoint

Form submits to: `https://aiblueprint.educationaiblueprint.com/api/webhooks/sendgrid`

Expected payload format:
```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "institution": "Example University",
  "role": "cio",
  "institutionType": "four-year-public",
  "interest": "assessment",
  "message": "We are interested in...",
  "timeline": "soon",
  "submittedAt": "2025-10-18T06:23:00.000Z",
  "source": "Lead Generation Page"
}
```

## Next Steps

1. Test the form with real submissions
2. Monitor Vercel logs for successful submissions
3. Verify emails are delivered to info@northpathstrategies.org
4. Consider adding honeypot field for spam prevention
5. Consider adding reCAPTCHA if spam becomes an issue

## Notes

- The form now has client-side validation before submission
- SendGrid webhook is already configured and working
- All required environment variables are set in Vercel
- The demo at /demo is working correctly and unaffected by these changes
