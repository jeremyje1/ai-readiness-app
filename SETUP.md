# AI Readiness Platform - Setup Guide

This guide walks you through setting up the AI Readiness Platform with its new streamlined assessment, document upload, and AI-powered gap analysis features.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Run these commands to set up everything automatically:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up database tables and storage
npm run setup:all

# Verify the setup
npm run verify:setup
```

## üìã Prerequisites

1. **Supabase Project**: Active Supabase project ([https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com))
2. **OpenAI API Key**: For AI document analysis ([https://platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com))
3. **Stripe Account**: For payment processing (already configured)
4. **Node.js**: Version 18+ installed

## üîß Automated Setup

### 1. Database Setup

Run the database setup script to create all required tables:

```bash
npm run setup:database
```

This creates:
- `uploaded_documents` - Stores document metadata and analysis
- `streamlined_assessment_responses` - Stores strategic assessment answers
- `gap_analysis_results` - Stores NIST framework gap analysis
- `implementation_roadmaps` - Stores 30/60/90-day action plans
- `user_activity_log` - Tracks user activities

All tables include:
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- Proper indexes for performance
- User-based access policies

### 2. Storage Setup

Create the storage bucket for document uploads:

```bash
npm run setup:storage
```

This creates:
- Storage bucket named `documents`
- 10MB file size limit
- Accepts PDF and Word documents only
- RLS policies for user-based access

### 3. Verify Setup

Check that everything is configured correctly:

```bash
npm run verify:setup
```

This verifies:
- ‚úÖ Environment variables are set
- ‚úÖ Database tables exist with RLS
- ‚úÖ Storage bucket is accessible
- ‚úÖ OpenAI API key is valid

## üîë Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file with these variables:

```env
# Supabase (Public)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key

# Supabase (Private)
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key

# OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

# Stripe (Already configured)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your-stripe-secret-key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-webhook-secret
```

## üìù Manual Setup (If Automated Fails)

### Option A: Supabase Dashboard - SQL Editor

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
2. Copy the SQL from `/tmp/create_tables.sql`
3. Run the SQL to create all tables

### Option B: Supabase Dashboard - Storage

1. Go to Storage ‚Üí New Bucket
2. Configure:
   - **Name**: `documents`
   - **Public**: No (private)
   - **File size limit**: 10 MB
   - **Allowed MIME types**:
     - `application/pdf`
     - `application/msword`
     - `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document`

3. Apply RLS policies in SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Enable RLS on storage.objects
ALTER TABLE storage.objects ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Policy: Users can upload their own documents
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload documents"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'documents' AND
  (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- Policy: Users can read their own documents
CREATE POLICY "Users can read documents"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'documents' AND
  (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- Policy: Users can update their own documents
CREATE POLICY "Users can update documents"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'documents' AND
  (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- Policy: Users can delete their own documents
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete documents"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'documents' AND
  (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Database Issues

```bash
# Check if tables exist
npm run verify:setup

# Re-run database setup
npm run setup:database

# Check Supabase logs
supabase db logs --tail
```

### Storage Issues

```bash
# Re-run storage setup
npm run setup:storage

# Test storage manually
curl -X GET https://your-project.supabase.co/storage/v1/bucket \
  -H "apikey: your-anon-key"
```

### OpenAI API Issues

```bash
# Test OpenAI connection
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key"
```

### Common Errors

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Table not found" | Run `npm run setup:database` |
| "Bucket not found" | Run `npm run setup:storage` or create manually |
| "Invalid API key" | Check `.env.local` has correct keys |
| "RLS policy violation" | Ensure user is authenticated |
| "File too large" | Files must be under 10MB |
| "Invalid file type" | Only PDF and Word documents allowed |
