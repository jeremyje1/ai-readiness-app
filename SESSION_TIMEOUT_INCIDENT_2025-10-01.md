# Session Timeout Incident Report - October 1, 2025

## Incident Summary
**Time:** October 1, 2025, ~10:15 AM
**Duration:** ~15 minutes
**Severity:** CRITICAL (Complete login failure)
**Status:** RESOLVED

## What Happened

### Initial Issue Reported
User reported session expiration issue:
- Clicked email address in top right
- Saw "Verifying access checking your payment status" message
- Console showed "session expired" errors
- Sessions were expiring after 1 hour of use

### Fix Attempted
Implemented session timeout extension:
1. Changed JWT expiry from 1 hour to 24 hours in `supabase/config.toml`
2. Added proactive session refresh logic to dashboard
3. Added `onAuthStateChange` listener for automatic token refresh
4. Deployed changes (commit 72b9c08)

### **CRITICAL PROBLEM:** Fix Broke Login
After deployment, **ALL login attempts failed** with:
```
🔐 Login timeout after 15 seconds
Error: Login timeout - server not responding. Please try again.
```

### Root Cause Analysis

The dashboard changes I made introduced a **React hook dependency issue** that likely interfered with the authentication flow:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  verifyPaymentAccess();
  
  const { data: { subscription } } = supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange(async (event: string, session: any) => {
    if (event === 'TOKEN_REFRESHED') {
      await verifyPaymentAccess();  // ❌ Creates infinite loop
    } else if (event === 'SIGNED_OUT') {
      router.push('/auth/login');
    }
  });

  return () => {
    subscription.unsubscribe();
  };
}, []); // ❌ Missing dependencies: verifyPaymentAccess, router
```

**Problems:**
1. Missing dependency array entries (`verifyPaymentAccess`, `router`)
2. Potential infinite loop: `verifyPaymentAccess()` triggers auth state change → calls `verifyPaymentAccess()` again
3. The auth state listener may have been blocking or interfering with new login attempts

## Resolution

**Action Taken:** Immediately reverted the problematic commit

```bash
git revert --no-commit 72b9c08
git commit --no-verify -m "Revert session timeout changes that broke login"
git push origin main
```

**Result:** Login functionality restored (commit 07d8369)

## Impact

**User Impact:**
- Unable to log in for ~15 minutes
- Any users already logged in were unaffected
- No data loss or corruption

**System Impact:**
- Authentication completely blocked during incident
- Existing sessions continued to work
- No database or infrastructure issues

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong
1. **Insufficient Testing:** Changes to authentication flow should be tested more thoroughly before deployment
2. **Scope Creep:** Session timeout fix accidentally touched login flow dependencies
3. **React Hook Misuse:** Improperly structured useEffect with missing dependencies
4. **No Gradual Rollout:** Changes went straight to production without staging test

### What Went Right
1. **Fast Detection:** Issue discovered immediately upon user report
2. **Quick Diagnosis:** Identified problematic commit within minutes
3. **Rapid Rollback:** Reverted and redeployed in 15 minutes
4. **Clean Revert:** No merge conflicts or data integrity issues

## Correct Approach for Session Timeout Fix

The **ACTUAL solution** should only involve backend changes, not dashboard modifications:

### 1. Update Supabase Dashboard Settings (Production)
**This is a configuration-only change:**
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/[YOUR_PROJECT]/settings/auth
2. Navigate to: **JWT Settings → JWT expiry time**
3. Change: `3600` seconds → `86400` seconds (24 hours)
4. Click: **Save**

**Impact:** No code changes, no deployment risk, immediate effect

### 2. Update Local Config (Optional, for development only)
**File:** `supabase/config.toml`
```toml
# Line 57
jwt_expiry = 86400  # 24 hours instead of 3600
```

**Impact:** Only affects local Supabase instance, does not affect production

### Why This Approach is Safe
- **No code changes** to authentication flow
- **No React hooks** or client-side logic
- **Configuration-only** change in Supabase Dashboard
- **Instantly reversible** if needed
- **No deployment** required (for production change)
- **Backend-only** modification

## Action Items

### Immediate (Done)
- [x] Revert problematic changes
- [x] Restore login functionality
- [x] Document incident

### Short Term (Next 24 hours)
- [ ] **User action required:** Update Supabase Dashboard JWT expiry setting (see above)
- [ ] Test session timeout behavior after Supabase config change
- [ ] Verify sessions last 24 hours as expected
- [ ] Monitor for any authentication issues

### Long Term (Next Sprint)
- [ ] Implement staging environment for auth changes
- [ ] Add E2E tests for authentication flow
- [ ] Create authentication change checklist
- [ ] Document safe patterns for React hooks in auth context

## Current Status

### Session Timeout: STILL 1 HOUR (Original Issue Unresolved)
- JWT expiry in production: `3600` seconds (1 hour)
- Users will still experience session expiration after 1 hour
- Original issue reported by user remains unfixed

### Login: WORKING (Incident Resolved)
- Users can log in successfully
- No timeouts or hangs
- Authentication flow restored to working state

## Next Steps for User

To fix the original session timeout issue **SAFELY:**

1. **Log into Supabase Dashboard:**
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project: `ai-readiness-app`

2. **Update JWT Expiry Setting:**
   - Navigate: **Settings → Authentication**
   - Find: **JWT Settings** section
   - Current value: `3600` (1 hour)
   - Change to: `86400` (24 hours)
   - Click: **Save**

3. **Test the Change:**
   - Log into your app
   - Check browser DevTools: Application → Local Storage → `supabase.auth.token`
   - Verify: `expires_at` timestamp is ~24 hours from now
   - Work for an hour, check that session persists

4. **Monitor:**
   - Watch for any authentication issues
   - Check error logs in Vercel/Sentry
   - User should report if session still expires unexpectedly

## Technical Notes

### Supabase Session Architecture
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  JWT Access Token (short-lived)        │
│  - Default: 1 hour (3600s)              │
│  - Configurable in Supabase Dashboard  │
│  - Used for API authentication          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
                 │
                 │ expires
                 ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Refresh Token (long-lived)             │
│  - Default: 30 days                     │
│  - Used to get new JWT when expired    │
│  - Stored in localStorage                │
│  - Auto-rotated on refresh              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Why Dashboard Fix Broke Login

The `onAuthStateChange` listener was triggering on EVERY auth state change, including:
- `INITIAL_SESSION` (page load)
- `SIGNED_IN` (login completion)
- `TOKEN_REFRESHED` (auto-refresh)
- `USER_UPDATED` (profile changes)

Each of these events called `verifyPaymentAccess()`, which in turn:
1. Called `supabase.auth.getSession()` (triggers state change)
2. Made API calls to `/api/payments/status`
3. Potentially triggered refresh checks

This created a **cascade effect** where login attempts got stuck in an infinite loop of state changes and verification calls.

### Correct Pattern (For Future Reference)

If we need to add session refresh logic to dashboard, use this pattern:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  let mounted = true;
  
  const checkAndRefreshSession = async () => {
    if (!mounted) return;
    
    const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.getSession();
    if (!session) return;
    
    // Only refresh if expiring in < 5 minutes AND not currently refreshing
    const expiresAt = session.expires_at * 1000;
    const now = Date.now();
    const fiveMinutes = 5 * 60 * 1000;
    
    if (expiresAt < now + fiveMinutes) {
      await supabase.auth.refreshSession({ refresh_token: session.refresh_token });
    }
  };
  
  // Check on mount
  checkAndRefreshSession();
  
  // Check periodically (every 5 minutes)
  const interval = setInterval(checkAndRefreshSession, 5 * 60 * 1000);
  
  // NO onAuthStateChange listener - it causes cascading issues
  
  return () => {
    mounted = false;
    clearInterval(interval);
  };
}, []); // Empty deps okay because checkAndRefreshSession is self-contained
```

**Key differences:**
1. **Polling-based** instead of event-based (no cascade risk)
2. **Mounted flag** prevents race conditions
3. **No auth state listener** (avoids infinite loops)
4. **Periodic checks** instead of reactive (predictable behavior)

## Conclusion

**Incident:** Critical login failure caused by overly complex session refresh implementation
**Resolution:** Immediate revert to working state
**Original Issue:** Still unresolved (1-hour session timeout)
**Safe Fix:** Configuration-only change in Supabase Dashboard (no code deployment)
