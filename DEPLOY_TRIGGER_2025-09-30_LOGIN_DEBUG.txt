DEPLOYMENT TRIGGER - Login Authentication Debug
=============================================
Date: 2025-09-30
Time: 10:58 AM PST
Commits: 3596dc0, 7b6c275

ISSUES ADDRESSED:
-----------------
1. Login page hanging after calling signInWithPassword
2. Timeout not being cleared in AuthService withTimeout method
3. Need for simplified debugging of authentication issues

CHANGES DEPLOYED:
-----------------

1. Fixed AuthService timeout bug (lib/auth-service.ts):
   - Added proper timeout cleanup when promises resolve
   - Clear timeout on both success and error cases
   - Prevents memory leaks and potential hanging

2. Added direct auth test page (app/test-direct-auth/page.tsx):
   - Simple page to test Supabase auth without any wrappers
   - Tests connection and direct authentication
   - Shows timing and detailed error messages
   - Accessible at /test-direct-auth

DEPLOYMENT STATUS:
------------------
- Git Push: âœ“ Successful
- Commit Hashes: 3596dc0, 7b6c275
- Branch: main
- Vercel should auto-deploy from these pushes

DEBUGGING STEPS:
----------------
1. After deployment, visit https://aiblueprint.higheredaiblueprint.com/test-direct-auth
2. Test the connection first (should be instant)
3. Test direct authentication with test@aiblueprint.com / TestPassword123!
4. Check browser console for detailed logs
5. If auth works here but not on login page, issue is with the login page code
6. If auth fails here too, issue is with Supabase connection or credentials

NOTES:
------
- The timeout fix should prevent the auth service from hanging
- Direct test page bypasses all middleware and guards
- This will help isolate if the issue is with Supabase or our code
