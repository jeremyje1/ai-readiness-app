🚨 CRITICAL PAYMENT EMAIL CONFLICT FIX - August 27, 2025

## ISSUE RESOLVED: Registration vs Billing Email Conflict

**PROBLEM**: Users could not register when their registration email differed from their credit card billing email. The system was creating accounts using the billing email from Stripe payment details instead of the email they used during registration.

**ROOT CAUSE**: Stripe webhook was using `session.customer_details.email` (billing email from payment method) instead of `session.customer_email` (registration email passed during checkout).

## ✅ CRITICAL FIXES DEPLOYED:

### 1. **Webhook Email Resolution Fix** (`stripe/webhook/route.ts`)
- **BEFORE**: `email: session.customer_details.email` (billing email)
- **AFTER**: `email: session.customer_email || session.customer_details.email` (registration email with fallback)
- Added logging to distinguish registration vs billing emails
- Prevents account conflicts when payment method email differs from signup email

### 2. **Registration Flow Enhancement** (`start/page.tsx`)
- **BEFORE**: Missing contact email in checkout URL
- **AFTER**: Passes `contact_email`, `contact_name`, and `organization` to checkout
- Ensures registration data flows through to payment processing

### 3. **Checkout Metadata Enhancement** (`stripe/unified-checkout/route.ts`)
- Added `organization` parameter support in checkout sessions
- Enhanced metadata includes user's name and organization from registration
- Better tracking and account creation accuracy

## 🔄 HOW IT WORKS NOW:

1. **User Registration**: `user@company.com` + organization details
2. **Checkout Process**: Registration email passed as `contact_email` parameter
3. **Stripe Session**: `customer_email` set to registration email, billing can differ
4. **Webhook Processing**: Uses registration email for account creation
5. **Result**: Successful account creation regardless of billing email differences
