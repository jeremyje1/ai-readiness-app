## 🏗️ Architecture

### Database Schema
```sql
-- 6 main tables with relationships

approval_notifications -- System notifications
```

### API Endpoints
```typescript
POST   /api/approvals              // Create new approval request
GET    /api/approvals              // List approvals with filters
GET    /api/approvals/dashboard    // Personal approval workload
PATCH  /api/approvals/:id/decision // Make approval decision
POST   /api/approvals/:id/comments // Add comments to approval
GET    /api/approvals/:id/comments // Get approval comments
```

### Type System
```typescript
interface Approval {
  id: string
  subjectType: 'policy' | 'artifact'
  subjectId: string
  status: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected' | 'changes_requested'
  approvers: Approver[]
  events: ApprovalEvent[]
  // ... complete type definitions
}
```

- **Personal Workload**: User-specific pending, approved, rejected views
- **Performance Metrics**: Average approval time, approval rates, trends
- **Overdue Tracking**: Automatic identification of past-due approvals
- **Filter & Search**: Advanced filtering by status, type, date ranges

### ✅ Audit Trail & Compliance
- **Complete History**: Every action logged with timestamp and user
- **Immutable Records**: Audit logs cannot be modified after creation
- **Event Timeline**: Chronological view of all approval activities
- **Metadata Tracking**: Rich context for each approval decision

### ✅ Comments & Discussion
- **Threaded Comments**: Discussion threads for approval collaboration

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Cypress E2E Tests
```typescript
// Complete workflow testing
✅ Create approval with multiple approvers
✅ First approver approves with e-signature
✅ Second approver rejects with comments  
✅ Dashboard shows updated status
✅ Approval history timeline
✅ Comment threads and discussions
✅ Overdue approval handling
✅ Error state management
✅ Audit log verification
```

### Test Scenarios
- **Happy Path**: Multi-approver approval completion
- **Rejection Flow**: Approver rejection with detailed comments
- **Mixed Decisions**: Some approve, some reject scenarios
- **Overdue Handling**: Past due date approval tracking
- **Error States**: API failure and network error handling

## 🎮 Demo Usage

### Access the Demo
```bash
# Visit the live demo page
http://localhost:3000/approval-demo
```

### Demo Flow
1. **Create Demo Approval** - Click button to generate sample approval
2. **View Dashboard** - See approval in pending tab with progress tracking
3. **Make Decisions** - Approve/reject with comments and e-signature
4. **View History** - Complete timeline of approval events
5. **Add Comments** - Discussion threads and collaboration

### Sample Approval Data
```json
{
  "subjectType": "policy",
  "subjectTitle": "Demo Data Protection Policy", 
  "approvers": [
    {"userId": "approver-1", "role": "Security Lead"},
    {"userId": "approver-2", "role": "Legal Counsel"}
  ],
  "dueDate": "7 days from creation",
  "metadata": {
    "priority": "medium",
    "tags": ["demo", "policy", "data-protection"]
  }
}
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install date-fns

# Database migration
psql -f database-migrations/025_approval_system.sql

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

### API Authentication
The system uses header-based user identification:
```typescript
headers: {
  'x-user-id': 'current-user-id'
}
```

## 📊 Dashboard Metrics
