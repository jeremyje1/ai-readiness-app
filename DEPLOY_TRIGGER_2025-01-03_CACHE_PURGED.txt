Time: ${new Date().toISOString()}
Status: CACHE PURGED - READY FOR CLEAN BUILD

Actions Completed:
✅ CDN Cache purged with tag: _next
✅ Fixed import issue (removed extractTextFromFile reference)
✅ Code verified - no incorrect imports exist

Expected Outcome:
- Clean build without cached import errors
- Successful compilation of document analysis features
- AI-powered analysis for paid users
- Demo analysis for free users

Build Should Include:
- lib/document-analysis.ts (with correct extractTextFromDocument function)
- app/api/documents/analyze/route.ts (with correct imports)
- components/AIReadinessDocumentUploader.tsx (updated UI)
- Database migration for document_analyses table

This deployment trigger forces a fresh build after cache purge.
