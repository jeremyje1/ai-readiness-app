-- ==============================================
-- 4. GRANT APPROPRIATE PERMISSIONS
-- ==============================================

-- Grant SELECT permissions on views to authenticated users
GRANT SELECT ON public.intake_forms_with_status TO authenticated;
GRANT SELECT ON public.user_approval_workload TO authenticated;
GRANT SELECT ON public.recent_approval_activity TO authenticated;
GRANT SELECT ON public.compliance_dashboard TO authenticated;
GRANT SELECT ON public.approved_tools_with_vendor TO authenticated;
GRANT SELECT ON public.approval_summary TO authenticated;
GRANT SELECT ON public.vendor_dashboard TO authenticated;

-- Grant appropriate permissions on tables
GRANT SELECT ON public.enterprise_algorithm_changelog TO authenticated;
GRANT SELECT ON public.institutions TO authenticated;
GRANT SELECT ON public.institution_memberships TO authenticated;
GRANT SELECT ON public.assessment_metrics TO authenticated;

-- ==============================================
-- COMPLETION MESSAGE
-- ==============================================

-- This script has:
-- 1. ✅ Enabled RLS on all public tables that were missing it
-- 2. ✅ Created comprehensive RLS policies for data access control
-- 3. ✅ Recreated all SECURITY DEFINER views as regular views
-- 4. ✅ Applied appropriate permissions for authenticated users
--
-- Security improvements:
-- - Tables now enforce row-level security based on user context
-- - Views use querying user's permissions instead of creator's
-- - Access is controlled by institution membership and user roles
-- - Data isolation between different institutions
