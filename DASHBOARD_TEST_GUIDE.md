# Quick Test Guide - Dashboard Fixes

## What Was Fixed:
1. ✅ Authentication timeout errors (increased to 15s with retry)
2. ✅ Confusing dashboard empty state (now has clear guidance)
3. ✅ Broken "Refresh Dashboard" button (replaced with actionable buttons)
4. ✅ No feedback after document upload (added loading states)

## Test After Deployment:

### Test 1: Document Upload Flow
1. Go to `/assessment/upload-documents`
2. Upload a document
3. Click "Continue with 1 Document"
4. **Expected:** See "Processing..." then redirect to dashboard
5. **Check:** Dashboard shows helpful empty state with 3 buttons

### Test 2: Dashboard Empty State
When you land on `/dashboard/personalized` without data:

**You Should See:**
- ✨ Blue box: "Your Analysis is Being Generated"
- Time estimates: "Assessment: 5 minutes • Upload: 3-5 minutes • Results: Instant"
- Three buttons:
  1. "Start Assessment" (purple) → goes to /assessment
  2. "Upload Documents" (outline) → goes to /assessment/upload-documents
  3. "Refresh Results" (ghost) → reloads page

**You Should NOT See:**
- ❌ "Refresh Dashboard" button that does nothing
- ❌ Console errors about timeouts
- ❌ Confusing empty screen

### Test 3: No More Timeout Errors
1. Open browser DevTools (F12) → Console tab
2. Navigate to dashboard
3. **Expected:** See loading messages, then success
4. **Should NOT see:** "Authentication timeout" or "Session check timeout"

### Test 4: All Buttons Work
Click each button on the empty dashboard:
- [ ] "Start Assessment" → Takes you to assessment page
- [ ] "Upload Documents" → Takes you to upload page
- [ ] "Refresh Results" → Reloads the page

## Success Criteria:

✅ No timeout errors in console
✅ Dashboard shows clear next steps
✅ All buttons navigate correctly
✅ User understands what to do
✅ Document upload has visible feedback

## If You Still See Issues:

1. **Clear browser cache:** Ctrl+Shift+Delete → Cached images/files
2. **Hard refresh:** Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
3. **Try incognito:** Open new private/incognito window
4. **Check console:** Look for any error messages
5. **Check Vercel:** Ensure latest deployment is active (commit c356c20)
