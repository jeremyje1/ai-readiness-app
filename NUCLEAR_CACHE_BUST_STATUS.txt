NUCLEAR CACHE BUSTING - October 3, 2025
========================================
Commit: c30a819

PROBLEM CONFIRMED:
------------------
Vercel's CDN/Edge network is serving OLD JavaScript bundles despite fresh builds:

Evidence:
- Build log shows: /get-started size changed from 6.47 kB to 6.51 kB (NEW CODE!)
- Browser loads: page-67ce153a3c115125.js (OLD HASH - hasn't changed in 3 deployments!)
- Console shows: "‚è≠Ô∏è Skipping manual profile creation" (code that doesn't exist anymore!)
- Build completed at 13:46:58, deployed commit c0d55f7
- User tested immediately after, still got old code

Root Cause:
Vercel's CDN (Content Delivery Network) caches JavaScript bundles aggressively.
Even though the server built new files, the CDN is serving old cached versions.

NUCLEAR OPTIONS APPLIED:
-------------------------

1. ‚úÖ next.config.js - generateBuildId()
   Forces unique build ID using git commit SHA or timestamp
   Each build gets completely unique identifier

2. ‚úÖ next.config.js - headers() for /get-started
   Added aggressive cache control headers:
   - no-store
   - no-cache  
   - must-revalidate
   - proxy-revalidate
   - max-age=0
   
   This tells browsers AND CDNs to NEVER cache the page

3. ‚úÖ vercel.json - Build environment config
   Already configured in previous deploy

VERIFICATION AFTER DEPLOYMENT:
-------------------------------
After deployment completes (~2-3 minutes):

1. **Hard refresh with cache bypass**: Cmd+Shift+R multiple times
2. **OR Clear all browser data**: Cmd+Shift+Delete
3. **Sign up with NEW email**
4. **Check for NEW bundle hash**:
   - Open DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
   - Look for `page-[HASH].js` files
   - Hash should be DIFFERENT from: page-67ce153a3c115125.js
   
5. **Check console for marker**:
   - MUST see: "üî• CACHE BUST v2 - October 3, 2025 13:45 CST"
   - MUST see: "üìù Creating user profile and institution..."
   - MUST NOT see: "‚è≠Ô∏è Skipping manual profile creation"

IF THIS STILL FAILS:
--------------------
If you STILL see page-67ce153a3c115125.js after this deployment, then:

**Option A: Wait for CDN TTL expiry**
- Vercel's edge cache may have a TTL (Time To Live) of 5-60 minutes
- The cache control headers will prevent FUTURE caching but won't purge existing cache
- Try again in 30-60 minutes

**Option B: Use Vercel Dashboard to redeploy**
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/jeremyje1s-projects/ai-readiness-app
2. Find the latest deployment (commit c30a819)
3. Click "..." menu ‚Üí "Redeploy"
4. This forces Vercel to purge CDN cache

**Option C: Contact Vercel Support**
- Request manual CDN cache purge
- Explain the issue with stale JavaScript bundles

**Option D: Create new project** (LAST RESORT)
- Deploy to a completely fresh Vercel project
- No cached files at all
- Use different domain or subdomain

TIMELINE:
---------
- 13:31:15 - Deploy 59046aa (restored cache)
- 13:42:18 - Deploy 9a16cab (cache bust attempt #1)
- 13:46:13 - Deploy c0d55f7 (aggressive cache bust)
- 13:50:xx - Deploy c30a819 (NUCLEAR - cache control headers) ‚Üê CURRENT

Current Status: Waiting for deployment c30a819 to complete and CDN to respect no-cache headers
