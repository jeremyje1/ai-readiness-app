3. If Blueprint selected:
   - User taken to `/blueprint/new`
   - Goal Setting Wizard appears (4 steps)
   - User defines goals, departments, preferences
   - Blueprint generation triggered automatically
4. Generation process:
   - Shows "Generating..." screen with auto-refresh
   - OpenAI creates comprehensive implementation plan
   - User redirected to completed blueprint view
5. Blueprint view:
   - Full plan with phases, tasks, tools
   - Department-specific recommendations
