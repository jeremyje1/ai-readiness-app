# AI Blueprint App - Fixes Summary - October 6, 2025

## Overview
Today we fixed several critical issues preventing blueprint generation and viewing:

## 1. ✅ Blueprint Generation Subscription Error
**Issue:** "Active subscription or credits required to generate blueprints"
**Cause:** Code was checking for non-existent `credits_remaining` field
**Fix:** Removed credit system logic, fixed subscription status check
**File:** `app/api/blueprint/generate/route.ts`

## 2. ✅ Invisible Buttons Throughout App 
**Issue:** Create Blueprint, Next, Submit buttons were invisible
**Cause:** Custom Tailwind classes (`np-primary-blue`, etc.) didn't exist
**Fix:** Replaced with standard indigo colors (`indigo-600`, `indigo-500`, etc.)
**Files:** 
- `components/button.tsx`
- `components/tour-config.ts`
- `components/onboarding-tour.tsx`

## 3. ✅ 401 API Authentication Errors
**Issue:** Loading loop after assessment completion, 401 errors on blueprint APIs
**Cause:** Using deprecated `createRouteHandlerClient` in Next.js 15
**Fix:** Updated to `createClient` from `@/lib/supabase/server`
**Files:**
- `app/api/blueprint/route.ts`
- `app/api/blueprint/[id]/route.ts`

## 4. ✅ 500 Blueprint Fetch Errors
**Issue:** Blueprint list page showing 500 errors
**Cause:** Using `!inner` joins that required related records to exist
**Fix:** Removed `!inner` to allow optional relationships
**File:** `app/api/blueprint/route.ts`

## 5. ✅ Email Service Implementation
**New Feature:** Complete email touchpoint system
**What's Added:**
- 7 email templates (welcome, assessment, blueprint, trial, progress, re-engagement)
- 2 automated cron jobs (trial reminders, re-engagement)
