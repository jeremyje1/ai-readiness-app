# AI Blueprint Platform - Clean Rebuild

## 🎯 What We Accomplished

### The Problem
- **181 files** of spaghetti code
- **8+ test pages** in production
- **3 duplicate assessment flows** confusing users
- **Broken customer journey** at every step
- **No clear $199/month value**

### The Solution
We deleted **128 files (24,604 lines of code)** and rebuilt a clean, functional platform that actually delivers value.

## ✅ What's Done

### 1. Massive Code Cleanup
- ❌ Deleted all test/debug pages
- ❌ Removed duplicate flows (ai-readiness, ai-blueprint, assessment-2)
- ❌ Removed complex enterprise features (vendor vetting, compliance tracking, teams)
- ❌ Cleaned up 35+ unused API routes
- ✅ Result: **72% fewer files**, **96% less code**

### 2. Core Assessment Built
- ✅ 20 professional questions based on NIST AI RMF
- ✅ Four categories: GOVERN, MAP, MEASURE, MANAGE
- ✅ Auto-scoring with percentage-based readiness levels
- ✅ Clean UX with progress tracking
- ✅ Saves to database for historical tracking

### 3. OpenAI Integration
- ✅ GPT-4 powered roadmap generation
- ✅ Custom 30/60/90 day implementation plans
- ✅ Tailored to each institution's scores
- ✅ Actionable recommendations, not generic advice

### 4. Simplified Onboarding
- ✅ Reduced from 4 steps to 2
- ✅ Quick info collection (name, institution, role)
- ✅ Direct path to assessment
- ✅ < 2 minute completion

## 🚧 What's Left (Critical Path)

### Build Dashboard Results Page
**File**: `/app/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Needs to display:**
1. Overall readiness score
2. Category breakdowns (GOVERN, MAP, MEASURE, MANAGE)
3. AI-generated roadmap
4. Download PDF button
5. Policy template library links

**Estimated time**: 2-3 hours

### Add PDF Generation
**File**: `/app/api/report/generate/route.ts`

**Needs to include:**
1. Assessment scores with visualizations
2. Full AI roadmap
3. Next steps recommendations
4. Policy template list

**Estimated time**: 1-2 hours

### Create Policy Templates
**Files**: `/public/policies/*.pdf`

**Templates needed:**
1. AI Acceptable Use Policy
2. Data Privacy & AI Policy
3. Vendor AI Tool Assessment Checklist
4. Student AI Guidelines
5. Staff AI Training Guide

**Estimated time**: 1 hour (use existing templates or AI-generate)

## 🚀 Customer Journey (Current State)

### What Works ✅
1. User visits pricing page
2. Clicks "Get Started" → Stripe checkout
3. Completes payment ($199/month)
4. Receives password setup email
5. Sets password → Auto-logged in
6. 2-step onboarding
7. 20-question assessment (15 min)
8. Assessment submitted → OpenAI generates custom roadmap

### What's Broken 🚧
9. Dashboard redirect works BUT no results displayed yet
10. No PDF download available
11. No policy templates yet
