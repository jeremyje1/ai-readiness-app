# Copy entire contents
# Paste into SQL Editor
# Click "Run"
```

**Verify**:
```sql
-- Should return table structure
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'demo_leads';

-- Should return empty result set
SELECT * FROM demo_leads LIMIT 1;
```

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring & Analytics

### Add Google Analytics Events (Optional)

**In WordPress page**:
```html
<script>
  // Track demo starts
  window.addEventListener('message', function(event) {
    if (event.data.type === 'demo_started') {
      gtag('event', 'demo_started', {
        'event_category': 'engagement',
        'event_label': 'AI Readiness Demo'
      });
    }
    if (event.data.type === 'demo_completed') {
      gtag('event', 'demo_completed', {
        'event_category': 'conversion',
        'event_label': 'AI Readiness Demo',
        'value': event.data.score
      });
    }
  });
</script>
```

### Check Supabase Dashboard

**Daily Report Query**:
```sql
-- Run this daily to track performance
SELECT 
  DATE(completed_at) as date,
  COUNT(*) as completions,
  ROUND(AVG(overall_score), 1) as avg_score,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE lead_qualification = 'HOT') as hot_leads,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE lead_qualification = 'WARM') as warm_leads,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE lead_qualification = 'COLD') as cold_leads,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE demo_scheduled = true) as demos_scheduled
FROM demo_leads
WHERE completed_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY DATE(completed_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Demo page is blank

**Solution**:
1. Check browser console (F12)
2. Look for CORS errors
3. Verify Vercel deployment succeeded
4. Test direct URL: `https://aiblueprint.educationaiblueprint.com/education-ai-blueprint-demo.html`

### Issue: Form submission fails

**Solution**:
1. Check Network tab (F12)
2. Look for 500 errors on `/api/demo/leads/create`
3. Check Vercel function logs: `vercel logs --follow`
4. Verify Supabase connection in environment variables

### Issue: Emails not sending

**Solution**:
1. Check SendGrid dashboard: https://app.sendgrid.com/
2. Verify API key is valid: `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $SENDGRID_API_KEY" https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/user/profile`
3. Check Vercel logs for email errors
4. Test email endpoint directly:
```bash
curl -X POST https://aiblueprint.educationaiblueprint.com/api/demo/emails/user-results \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"leadData":{"first_name":"Test","last_name":"User","email":"your-email@test.com","institution_name":"Test U","institution_type":"K-12","role":"CIO"},"results":{"overallScore":67,"readinessLevel":"Emerging","categoryScores":{"Strategy & Vision":75},"quickWins":[],"estimatedImpact":{"costSavings":"$30K","timeSaved":"800hrs","efficiencyGain":"15%"},"percentile":58}}'
```

### Issue: Database errors

**Solution**:
1. Verify migration was applied: `SELECT * FROM demo_leads LIMIT 1;`
2. Check RLS policies are enabled: `SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'demo_leads';`
3. Verify Supabase environment variables in Vercel
4. Check Supabase logs for connection errors
