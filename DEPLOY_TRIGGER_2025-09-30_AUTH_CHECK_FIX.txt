DEPLOYMENT TRIGGER - Fix Authentication Check on Start Page
==========================================================
Date: 2025-09-30
Time: 10:54 AM PST
Commit: 595675e

ISSUE FIXED:
-----------
- Start page was showing "Checking authentication status..." indefinitely
- PasswordSetupGuard was checking authentication on public pages
- This prevented new users from accessing the signup/start flow

CHANGES DEPLOYED:
-----------------

1. Updated PasswordSetupGuard.tsx:
   - Added public paths that don't require authentication check
   - Excluded these paths: /auth/, /login, /start, /pricing, /privacy, /terms, /contact, /services, /
   - Changed isAuthPage to isPublicPage for clarity
   - Fixed all references to use the new variable name

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
------------------
- The PasswordSetupGuard wraps the entire app in layout.tsx
- It was checking for password setup requirements on all pages
- Public pages (like /start) don't have authenticated sessions
- This caused the guard to get stuck in the "checking" state

DEPLOYMENT STATUS:
------------------
- Git Push: âœ“ Successful
- Commit Hash: 595675e
- Branch: main
- Vercel should auto-deploy from this push

VERIFICATION STEPS:
-------------------
1. Check Vercel dashboard for new deployment
2. Test https://aiblueprint.higheredaiblueprint.com/start?billing=monthly
3. Verify the page loads without showing "Checking authentication status..."
4. Test that the start flow works for new users
5. Verify authenticated pages still check for password setup when needed

NOTES:
------
- This fix allows unauthenticated users to access public pages
- The guard still protects authenticated areas of the app
- Password setup flow remains intact for users who need it
