## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps

### Step 1: DNS Configuration (5-10 minutes) ⚠️

**Action Required:** Add CNAME record in your DNS provider for `educationaiblueprint.com`:

```
Type:  CNAME
Name:  aiblueprint
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
TTL:   Auto (or 300 seconds)
```

**Common DNS Providers:**
- **GoDaddy:** Domain Settings → DNS → Add Record
- **Namecheap:** Domain List → Manage → Advanced DNS
- **Cloudflare:** DNS → Add Record
- **Google Domains:** DNS → Custom records

⏱️ **Propagation Time:** 5-10 minutes (sometimes up to 30 minutes)

Check propagation: https://dnschecker.org/#CNAME/aiblueprint.educationaiblueprint.com

---

### Step 2: Deploy to Production (2 minutes)

Once DNS is configured, deploy:

```bash
cd /Users/jeremy.estrella/Desktop/ai-readiness-app-main
vercel --prod
```

This will deploy with all the new environment variables and domain configuration.

---

### Step 3: Update Stripe URLs (5 minutes)

Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/products

Find your **AI Blueprint EDU** product (Price ID: `price_1SDnhlRMpSG47vNmDQr1WeJ3`)

Update the checkout URLs:

**Success URL:**
```
https://aiblueprint.educationaiblueprint.com/auth/success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}
```

**Cancel URL:**
```
https://aiblueprint.educationaiblueprint.com/pricing?status=cancelled

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### DNS Not Propagating?
```bash

dig aiblueprint.educationaiblueprint.com CNAME

# Expected output:
# aiblueprint.educationaiblueprint.com. 300 IN CNAME cname.vercel-dns.com.
```

### Authentication Issues?
1. Check Supabase dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/jocigzsthcpspxfdfxae/auth/users

3. Check browser console for errors
4. Test with incognito window

### Domain Not Working?
1. Verify DNS CNAME added correctly
2. Wait 10-15 minutes for propagation
3. Clear browser cache
