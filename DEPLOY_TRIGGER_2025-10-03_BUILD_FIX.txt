CRITICAL BUILD FIX:
-------------------
Fixed build failure caused by missing OpenAI API key in production environment.

CHANGES MADE:
1. Made OpenAI integration optional - assessment will work without API key
2. Added null checks to prevent runtime errors
3. Provided fallback roadmap when OpenAI is not configured
4. Build will now succeed without OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable

FILES MODIFIED:
- app/api/assessment/submit/route.ts

DEPLOYMENT URGENCY: CRITICAL  
Previous deployment failed to build. This fix is required for any deployment.

TESTING NOTES:
1. Assessment submission should work with or without OpenAI API key
2. When API key is missing, basic roadmap is provided
3. When API key is present, AI-generated roadmap is provided

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
Optional: OPENAI_API_KEY (if not set, fallback roadmap will be used)
