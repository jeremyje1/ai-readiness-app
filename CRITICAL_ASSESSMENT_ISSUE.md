# CRITICAL ISSUE: Assessment Not Collecting Scores

**Date:** January 8, 2025  
**Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL  
**Status:** Identified - Requires Immediate Fix

---

## Problem Summary

The application is showing zeros across the board on the dashboard because **the assessment page is not actually collecting the NIST framework question responses**. 

### What's Happening

1. User signs up ‚Üí goes to `/welcome`
2. User clicks "Start Assessment" ‚Üí goes to `/assessment`
3. `/assessment` page is just a 4-step demographic intake form:
   - Step 1: Institution context (type, size, state)
   - Step 2: AI journey stage & challenges
   - Step 3: Priorities & timeline
   - Step 4: Contact information
4. **NO NIST FRAMEWORK QUESTIONS ARE ASKED**
5. **NO SCORES ARE CALCULATED**
6. Only demographic data is saved to database
7. Dashboard has no scores to display ‚Üí shows zeros

### Root Cause

The `/assessment` page (`app/assessment/page.tsx`) is using a simplified intake form instead of the full NIST AI RMF assessment. The actual assessment questions exist in:
- `/data/ai-readiness-questions.json` (105 questions)
- `/lib/ai-readiness-questions.ts` (question definitions)
- Components like `AssessmentWizard.tsx` exist but aren't being used

### Evidence

Checked database for test user `test_959fa739@example.com`:
```
üìä Checking streamlined_assessment_responses...
‚ÑπÔ∏è No assessments found

üìà Checking gap_analysis_results...
‚ÑπÔ∏è No gap analysis found
```

No assessment data exists because the actual NIST questions were never presented to the user.

---

## Expected Behavior

### The assessment SHOULD:

1. **Ask 20-40 NIST Framework Questions** across 4 categories:
   - GOVERN (5 questions)
   - MAP (5 questions)
   - MEASURE (5 questions)
   - MANAGE (5 questions)

2. **Each question rated 0-3:**
   - 0 = Not at all / No progress
   - 1 = Limited / Early stages  
   - 2 = Moderate / In progress
   - 3 = Excellent / Well established

3. **Calculate scores** after submission:
   - Category scores (percentage per category)
   - Overall score (total percentage)
   - Maturity level (Beginning/Emerging/Developing/Advanced)

4. **Save to database:**
   - `streamlined_assessment_responses.responses` = {1: 2, 2: 3, 3: 1, ...}
   - `streamlined_assessment_responses.scores` = {GOVERN: {score: 8, percentage: 53}, ...}
   - `streamlined_assessment_responses.readiness_level` = "Developing"

5. **Create gap analysis** for dashboard display

## Current State vs Should Be

### What Exists Now (BROKEN)

`/app/assessment/page.tsx`:
- Simple 4-step form
- Collects demographics only
- No scoring questions
- No score calculation
- Saves incomplete data
- Dashboard shows zeros

### What Should Exist

`/app/assessment/page.tsx` should:
- Display NIST framework questions
- Allow user to rate each question 0-3
- Calculate scores after completion
- Save responses + scores to database
- Create gap_analysis_results entry
- Redirect to document upload
- Dashboard displays actual scores

---

## Files That Need Fixing

### 1. `/app/assessment/page.tsx` (PRIMARY FIX NEEDED)
**Current:** 665 lines of demographic form  
**Needs:** Complete rewrite to use NIST questions

**Required Changes:**
- Import questions from `/lib/ai-readiness-questions.ts`
- Display questions in sections (GOVERN, MAP, MEASURE, MANAGE)
- Collect responses (0-3 rating for each question)
- Calculate scores using logic from `/app/api/assessment/submit/route.ts`
- Submit responses + scores to API
- Handle completion and redirect

### 2. `/app/api/assessment/submit/route.ts` (ALREADY CORRECT)
**Status:** ‚úÖ This file is correct and ready to receive data
- Has `calculateScores()` function
- Creates gap_analysis_results
- Generates AI roadmap
- Saves everything properly

**The problem:** It's never being called with actual question responses!

### 3. Database Tables (ALREADY CORRECT)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Tables exist and are correct
- `streamlined_assessment_responses` has columns for `responses` and `scores`
- `gap_analysis_results` ready to receive scores
- RLS policies in place

---

## Quick Fix Solution

### Option 1: Use Existing Questions (RECOMMENDED)

Rewrite `/app/assessment/page.tsx` to:

```typescript
// Use questions from lib
import { aiReadinessQuestions } from '@/lib/ai-readiness-questions';

// Group by NIST category
const categories = {
  GOVERN: questions.slice(0, 5),
  MAP: questions.slice(5, 10),
  MEASURE: questions.slice(10, 15),
  MANAGE: questions.slice(15, 20)
};

// Collect responses
const [responses, setResponses] = useState<Record<number, number>>({});

// Display questions with 0-3 rating
{categories.GOVERN.map((q, idx) => (
  <QuestionCard 
    question={q}
    value={responses[idx]}
    onChange={(val) => setResponses({...responses, [idx]: val})}
  />
))}

// On submit
const handleSubmit = async () => {
  const res = await fetch('/api/assessment/submit', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      userId,
      answers: responses, // {0: 2, 1: 3, 2: 1, ...}
      completedAt: new Date().toISOString()
    })
  });
  
  if (res.ok) {
    router.push('/assessment/upload-documents');
  }
};
```

### Option 2: Simplified 20-Question Assessment

Create a minimal NIST assessment with 5 questions per category (20 total):
- Faster to complete (5-10 minutes)
- Still provides scores
- Maintains NIST framework structure
- Better UX for initial release

## Impact Analysis

### Current Impact
- ‚ùå Users complete "assessment" but get no scores
- ‚ùå Dashboard shows all zeros
- ‚ùå No gap analysis generated
- ‚ùå No blueprint can be created (requires scores)
- ‚ùå Marketing claims are not met ("5-minute assessment", "NIST framework")
- ‚ùå User experience is broken and confusing

### After Fix
- ‚úÖ Users answer actual NIST questions
- ‚úÖ Scores calculated and saved
- ‚úÖ Dashboard shows real readiness data
- ‚úÖ Gap analysis generated
- ‚úÖ Blueprint generation works
- ‚úÖ Marketing claims accurate
- ‚úÖ Complete user flow working

## Recommended Action Plan

### Immediate (Today)
1. ‚è∞ **URGENT:** Rewrite `/app/assessment/page.tsx`
   - Use simplified 20-question version (5 per category)
   - Implement 0-3 rating scale
   - Add score calculation
   - Test with real user flow

2. Test complete flow:
   - Signup ‚Üí Assessment ‚Üí Upload ‚Üí Dashboard
   - Verify scores appear
   - Verify gap analysis created
   - Verify blueprint can be generated

3. Deploy to production immediately after testing

### Short-term (This Week)
4. Add progress indicators
5. Add help text for questions
6. Improve question UI/UX
7. Add ability to save and resume

### Medium-term (Next Week)
8. Consider expanding to full 40-question assessment
9. Add question categories/sections
10. Add domain-specific questions (K-12 vs Higher Ed)

### Working Score Calculation (from submit route)
```typescript
function calculateScores(answers: Record<number, number>) {
    const categories = {
        GOVERN: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
        MAP: [6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
        MEASURE: [11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
        MANAGE: [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]
    };

    const scores: Record<string, { score: number; maxScore: number; percentage: number }> = {};
    
    for (const [category, questionIds] of Object.entries(categories)) {
        let categoryScore = 0;
        let categoryMax = questionIds.length * 3;

        questionIds.forEach(qId => {
            const answer = answers[qId - 1];
            if (answer !== undefined) {
                categoryScore += answer;
            }
        });

        scores[category] = {
            score: categoryScore,
            maxScore: categoryMax,
            percentage: Math.round((categoryScore / categoryMax) * 100)
        };
    }

    return scores;
}
```

## Summary

**The assessment page is completely broken** - it's not asking the NIST framework questions that are required to generate scores. This is why you're seeing zeros everywhere.

**Solution:** Rewrite `/app/assessment/page.tsx` to display actual assessment questions and collect scored responses.

**Priority:** üî¥ CRITICAL - This blocks the entire user experience and makes the product non-functional.

**Next Step:** I can create the fixed assessment page now if you'd like me to proceed.
