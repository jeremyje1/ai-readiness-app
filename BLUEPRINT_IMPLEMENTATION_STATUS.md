## Technical Architecture

### Database Structure
```
blueprints (master table)
├── blueprint_goals (user objectives)
├── blueprint_phases (implementation stages)
│   └── blueprint_tasks (actionable items)
├── blueprint_progress (tracking)
├── blueprint_comments (collaboration)
└── blueprint_templates (reusable)
```

### API Architecture
```
/api/blueprint/
├── goals/ (CRUD for goals)
├── generate/ (AI generation)
├── [id]/ (blueprint operations)
│   ├── share/ (sharing management)
│   └── progress/ (progress tracking)
└── templates/ (coming soon)
```

### Service Layer
- BlueprintService: Orchestrates generation process
- BlueprintGenerator: AI-powered content creation
- Integration with OpenAI GPT-4
- Leverages existing assessment algorithms

## Current Blockers
None - Ready to proceed with UI implementation

## Next Steps
1. Create Goal Setting Wizard component
2. Build Blueprint Viewer interface
3. Implement assessment-to-blueprint flow
4. Add blueprint links to navigation
5. Test end-to-end generation process

## Files Created/Modified
### New Files
- `/types/blueprint.ts` - Type definitions
- `/lib/blueprint/blueprint-service.ts` - Core service
- `/lib/blueprint/blueprint-generator.ts` - AI generator
- `/app/api/blueprint/goals/route.ts` - Goals API
- `/app/api/blueprint/generate/route.ts` - Generation API
- `/app/api/blueprint/route.ts` - List API
- `/app/api/blueprint/[id]/route.ts` - CRUD API
- `/app/api/blueprint/[id]/share/route.ts` - Sharing API
- `/app/api/blueprint/[id]/progress/route.ts` - Progress API
- `/supabase/migrations/20251005_create_blueprint_tables.sql` - Database schema

### Migration Required
```bash
# Apply database migration
supabase db push
```

## Deployment Notes
- Requires OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
- Database migration must be run before deployment
- Consider rate limiting for generation endpoint
- Monitor OpenAI API usage and costs

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Users can set implementation goals
- [ ] Blueprints generate within 2-3 minutes
- [ ] Generated content is relevant and actionable
- [ ] Progress tracking accurately reflects task completion
- [ ] Sharing functionality works seamlessly

## Timeline
