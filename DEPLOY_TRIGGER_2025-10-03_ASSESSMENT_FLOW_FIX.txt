CRITICAL FIX SUMMARY:
--------------------
Fixed assessment flow issue where survey was repeating after document upload prompt.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION:
- User completes assessment
- Sees "Continue to Document Upload" button
- Assessment was redirecting to dashboard instead of document upload
- This caused confusion and made it seem like assessment was repeating

2. Fixed assessment completion to redirect to document upload page
3. Document upload page includes:
   - Clear success message showing assessment is complete

   - Skip option to go directly to dashboard
   - Proper authentication and flow checks

FILES MODIFIED:
- app/assessment/page.tsx - Changed redirect from /dashboard/personalized to /assessment/upload-documents
- app/assessment/upload-documents/page.tsx - New page for document upload step

USER FLOW NOW:
1. User completes assessment questions
2. Clicks "Continue to Document Upload"  
3. Lands on document upload page (optional step)
4. Can upload documents or skip
5. Proceeds to personalized dashboard

TESTING NOTES:
1. Complete an assessment and verify it redirects to upload page
2. Verify upload page shows assessment complete message
