# AI Readiness Metrics Update - October 6, 2025

## Issue
- Readiness scores (DSCH, LEI, CRF, OCI, HOCI) were displayed without explanation
- Users couldn't understand what these acronyms meant
- Scores were showing as small decimals (0.54%) instead of percentages (54%)

## Changes Made

### BlueprintViewer Component Updates
1. **Added metric explanations** for each readiness score:
   - **DSCH** → Digital Strategy & Capability
   - **CRF** → Change Readiness  
   - **LEI** → Leadership Effectiveness
   - **OCI** → Organizational Culture
   - **HOCI** → Operational Capability

2. **Fixed percentage display**: Scores now properly multiply by 100 (0.54 → 54%)

3. **Added overall readiness summary**:
   - Displays overall AI readiness percentage prominently
   - Shows maturity level alongside the score
   - Better visual hierarchy with indigo-themed card

## Context
These metrics come from the enterprise readiness assessment framework:
- **Digital Strategy & Capability (DSCH)**: Measures strategic planning, technology integration, and leadership alignment
- **Change Readiness (CRF)**: Evaluates organizational agility and innovation capacity
- **Leadership Effectiveness (LEI)**: Assesses leadership understanding and decision-making efficiency
- **Organizational Culture (OCI)**: Measures employee engagement and collaboration readiness
- **Operational Capability (HOCI)**: Evaluates process efficiency and technical infrastructure

Each metric is calculated based on assessment responses and organizational factors, providing a comprehensive view of AI readiness across different dimensions.
