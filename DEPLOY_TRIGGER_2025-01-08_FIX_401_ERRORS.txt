DEPLOYMENT - FIX 401 AUTHENTICATION ERRORS
Date: January 8, 2025  
Time: ~14:00 CST

## Issues Fixed

### Problem
Client-side components were calling server-side API routes that require authentication cookies:
- `/api/blueprint?limit=3` - returning 401
- `/api/assessment/check` - returning 401

### Root Cause
`BlueprintDashboardWidget` is a client component (`'use client'`) that was using `fetch()` to call server-side API routes. Client-side fetch calls don't automatically include authentication cookies in the same way server-side calls do.

### Solution Implemented
1. **Removed API calls from client component** - Deleted `fetchBlueprints()` and `checkAssessment()` functions from `BlueprintDashboardWidget`
2. **Moved data fetching to parent component** - Dashboard page now fetches blueprint data using Supabase client (which has access to auth cookies)
3. **Props-based data flow** - Pass fetched data as props to `BlueprintDashboardWidget`

### Files Modified
- `components/blueprint/BlueprintDashboardWidget.tsx` - Now accepts data via props
- `app/dashboard/personalized/page.tsx` - Fetches blueprint data and passes to widget

### Testing
- Created diagnostic scripts (`diagnose-auth-issues.js`, `test-user-flow.js`) to identify the authentication pattern
- Confirmed 401 errors are expected for unauthenticated requests
- Verified solution follows Next.js 15 best practices for client/server component data flow

## Deployment Details
- Commit: 2a68a9e
- Vercel URL: https://ai-readiness-3vefj6vc7-jeremys-projects-73929cad.vercel.app
- Production domain: https://aiblueprint.educationaiblueprint.com

## Expected Results
- No more 401 errors in browser console for `/api/blueprint` and `/api/assessment/check`
- Dashboard loads blueprint data correctly
- Assessment completion status displays properly
- Smoother user experience with no failed API calls

## Notes
This follows Next.js 15 best practices:
- Server components for data fetching (or client components with Supabase client)
- Props for passing data to child components
- Avoid fetch() calls from client components to own API routes
