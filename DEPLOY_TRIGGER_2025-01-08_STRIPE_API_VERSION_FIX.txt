Deployment Trigger
==================
Date: 2025-01-08
Purpose: Fix Stripe connection error by removing API version

Changes:
- Removed API version '2025-06-30.basil' from Stripe initialization
- Simplified Stripe SDK usage for compatibility
- Created minimal test endpoint to diagnose connectivity

Test endpoints:
1. /api/stripe/minimal-test - Basic Stripe connection test
2. /api/stripe/test-connection - Lists prices without API version
3. /api/stripe/edu-checkout - Main payment endpoint (simplified)

Expected outcome: Stripe should connect without throwing StripeConnectionError
