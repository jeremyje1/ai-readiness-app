# üöÄ PRODUCTION DEPLO## Final Configuration Steps

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Stripe Webhook Configuration

The production system is fully deployed and configured:

1. **‚úÖ Stripe Webhook Endpoint Configured:**

   - Events: `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.*`, `invoice.payment_*`
   - Status: Active and receiving webhooks

2. **‚úÖ Webhook Secret Added to Vercel:**

**üéâ SUCCESS: The critical production fix is now complete! Paying customers will receive proper AI assessment services instead of demo content.**ITICAL PAYMENT FIX

## ‚úÖ DEPLOYED SUCCESSFULLY
**Production URL**: https://aiblueprint.k12aiblueprint.com
**Higher Ed URL**: https://aiblueprint.higheredaiblueprint.com
*(Both domains serve the same application with middleware-based routing)*

## ‚úÖ DATABASE MIGRATION COMPLETED
The `user_payments` table has been successfully created in your Supabase database with all required indexes, RLS policies, and triggers.

## üéØ CRITICAL FIXES DEPLOYED
1. **Real Payment Verification** - No more demo content for paying customers

## üîß MANUAL STEPS REQUIRED (Complete These Now)

### ‚úÖ 1. DATABASE MIGRATION - COMPLETED
The `user_payments` table has been successfully created in your Supabase database.

### 2. CONFIGURE STRIPE WEBHOOK

**Go to**: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks

**Steps**:
1. Click "Add endpoint"
2. Set URL to: `https://aiblueprint.k12aiblueprint.com/api/stripe/webhook`
   *(Note: This serves both K-12 and Higher Ed via middleware routing)*
3. Select these events:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `customer.subscription.created`
   - `customer.subscription.updated` 
   - `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - `invoice.payment_succeeded`
   - `invoice.payment_failed`
4. Click "Add endpoint"
5. Copy the webhook signing secret and update your production environment variables

### 3. UPDATE PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL

**Go to**: https://vercel.com/jeremys-projects-73929cad/ai-readiness-app/settings/environment-variables

**Add/Update these environment variables** (most should already be set from .env.local):
```
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=[your-new-webhook-secret-from-step-2]
```

The other environment variables should already be deployed from your .env.local file.

## üß™ TESTING THE FIX

### Test Payment Flow:
1. **Go to**: https://aiblueprint.k12aiblueprint.com/ai-readiness *(or higheredaiblueprint.com)*
2. **Complete a test purchase** using Stripe test mode
3. **Verify webhook receives payment** (check Stripe webhook logs)
4. **Check user is created** in Supabase `user_payments` table
5. **Test dashboard access** - should show payment verification, not demo

### Expected Behavior:
- ‚ùå **Before**: All users got demo content regardless of payment
- ‚úÖ **After**: Only paying customers get real assessment access
- ‚úÖ **New Users**: Must pay before accessing dashboard
- ‚úÖ **Paid Users**: Get tier-appropriate assessment access

---

## üö® IMMEDIATE IMPACT

**This deployment fixes the critical production issue where**:
- Customers paying $995-$24,500 were receiving fake demo content
- No payment verification was happening
- Hardcoded demo emails were being sent automatically

**Now**:
- ‚úÖ Real payment verification before dashboard access
- ‚úÖ Actual user account creation via webhooks
- ‚úÖ Tier-based service delivery
- ‚úÖ No more demo content for paying customers

---

## üìû NEXT STEPS

1. **Complete the 3 manual steps above** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
2. **Test the payment flow** with a small test transaction
3. **Monitor webhook logs** in Stripe dashboard
4. **Check Supabase logs** for user creation
5. **Identify existing paying customers** and manually provision their access if needed

**Status**: CRITICAL FIX DEPLOYED - Manual configuration required to complete
**Priority**: IMMEDIATE - Complete manual steps to stop serving demos to paying customers
