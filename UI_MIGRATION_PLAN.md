## ðŸ”§ Commands to Run

Tell the other Copilot (in main app workspace):

```
I want to adopt the beautiful interface design from the AI readiness app. Please help me:

1. Copy the UI components from the AI readiness app (card, button, progress, etc.)
2. Update our assessment pages to use the same clean, card-based layout
3. Apply the gradient backgrounds and professional styling
4. Implement the same question presentation format with progress tracking
5. Ensure responsive design and consistent typography

The AI readiness app has a much cleaner, more professional interface that we should adopt across the organizational realignment app.
