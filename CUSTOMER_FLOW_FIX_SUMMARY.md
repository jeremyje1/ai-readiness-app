# Customer Flow Fix Summary

## What Was Wrong
The `/start` page was trying to call a non-existent API endpoint (`/api/user/register`) that was removed during the cleanup phase. This caused the "Registration failed" error you saw in the screenshot.

## What I Fixed

### 1. Removed Broken Registration Flow
- The `/start` page was trying to register users through a legacy API endpoint
- This endpoint was removed during cleanup, causing HTML error responses

### 2. Updated Customer Flow
Now the flow works as follows:

```
Marketing Page / Start Page
    ↓
Sign Up Page (/auth/signup)
    ↓
Email Confirmation
    ↓
7-Day Trial Access
    ↓
Dashboard
```

### 3. Specific Changes Made

#### `/app/start/page.tsx`
- Removed API call to `/api/user/register`
- Now redirects to `/auth/signup` with pre-filled form data
- Stores registration data in sessionStorage

#### `/app/auth/signup/page.tsx`
- Added support for URL parameters (email, name, organization)
- Pre-fills form with data from /start page

#### `marketing-page.html`
- Updated all CTAs to point to `/auth/signup` instead of `/start` or `/auth/login?signup=true`
- Changed "Start Free Assessment" to "Start Free Trial"
- Updated "Take Free Assessment" to "Start Free Trial"

## New Customer Journey

### Option 1: Direct Sign Up
1. User visits `/auth/signup` directly
2. Fills out sign-up form
3. Receives confirmation email
4. Clicks confirmation link
5. Accesses dashboard with 7-day trial

### Option 2: From Marketing Page
1. User clicks any "Get Started" or "Start Free Trial" button
2. Redirected to `/auth/signup`
3. Follows steps 2-5 from Option 1

### Option 3: From Start Page (Legacy Support)
1. User visits `/start` page
2. Selects institution type
3. Fills out initial form
4. Redirected to `/auth/signup` with pre-filled data
5. Completes signup and follows email confirmation flow
