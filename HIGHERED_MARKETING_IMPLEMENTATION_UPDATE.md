## Contextual Differences from K-12

| Element | K-12 Version | Higher Ed Version |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Pilot Scale | "First 6 Classrooms / 3 Courses" | "First 5 Departments / 3 Programs" |
| Hierarchy | superintendent ‚Üí principals ‚Üí teachers | provost ‚Üí deans ‚Üí faculty |
| Development | Professional Development | Faculty Development |
| Units | Classrooms/Courses | Departments/Programs |
| Leadership | School Board | Board and Trustees |
| Compliance | COPPA/FERPA/PPRA | NIST AI RMF + Ed Dept |

The Higher Ed page now effectively communicates that university subscribers receive not just policies and plans, but complete execution-ready packages that eliminate the gap between institutional decision and academic implementation, specifically tailored to the complexity and hierarchy of higher education institutions.
