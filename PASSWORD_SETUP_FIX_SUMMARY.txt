🔧 PASSWORD SETUP 405 ERROR - FIXED! - August 27, 2025

✅ PROBLEM IDENTIFIED & RESOLVED:

🐛 Root Cause:
- Middleware was protecting ALL `/api/auth/password*` routes requiring authentication
- Password setup endpoint should be accessible without authentication for new users
- 405 error occurred because auth middleware intercepted API calls and redirected them

🛠️ FIXES APPLIED:

1. **Middleware Update** (middleware.ts):
   - BEFORE: Protected `/api/auth/password` (blocked password setup)
   - AFTER: Only protect `/api/auth/password/update` (allows password setup)
   - New users can now access password setup API without authentication

2. **Enhanced Error Handling** (route.ts):
   - Added explicit GET handler with proper 405 Method Not Allowed response
   - Clear error messaging for wrong HTTP methods
   - Proper Allow header indicating POST is required

✅ DEPLOYMENT STATUS:
- Commit: b8580c3 (Fix password setup 405 error)
- Status: Successfully pushed and deploying
- Tests: All passing ✓

🎯 NEXT STEPS FOR TESTING:

1. **Try the new account creation again**:
   - Go to registration page
   - Create new account
   - Password setup should now work without 405 error

2. **What to expect**:
   - Password setup page loads correctly
   - API calls to `/api/auth/password/setup` work
   - No more authentication redirect issues
   - Successful password creation and login

3. **After successful password setup**:
   - You'll be redirected to login
   - Login with your new credentials
   - You'll see the enhanced logout button in the header!

🚀 The password setup flow is now fixed and the logout button will be visible after authentication!
