## üì¶ How to Deploy to WordPress

### Option A: Direct HTML Upload (Recommended for Static Page)

1. **Save the HTML file locally**
   - File location: `/Users/jeremy.estrella/Desktop/ai-readiness-app-main/lead-generation-page.html`

2. **Update the API endpoint for production**
   - Find line ~1120 in `lead-generation-page.html`
   - Change: `const FORM_ENDPOINT = '/api/contact';`
   - To: `const FORM_ENDPOINT = 'https://educationaiblueprint.com/api/contact';`
   - (Replace with your actual production domain)

3. **Upload to WordPress**
   - **Method 1:** Create new page ‚Üí Switch to "Code Editor" ‚Üí Paste entire HTML
   - **Method 2:** Use "Custom HTML" block in Gutenberg editor
   - **Method 3:** Add as child theme template file

4. **Publish and test**
   - Submit test form from live WordPress page
   - Verify email delivery
   - Check for console errors

### Option B: Host Separately and Embed

1. **Host on subdomain** (e.g., `leads.northpathstrategies.org`)
2. **Embed in WordPress** using iframe:
   ```html
   <iframe src="https://leads.northpathstrategies.org" 
           width="100%" 
           height="2000" 
           frameborder="0">
   </iframe>
   ```

### Option C: Use WordPress Plugin (Advanced)

Use a plugin like "Insert Headers and Footers" or "Code Snippets" to add the HTML to a dedicated page template.

## üîí Security & CORS Configuration

### If Hosting on Different Domain Than API

If your WordPress site is on a different domain than your API (e.g., WordPress on `northpathstrategies.org` but API on `educationaiblueprint.com`), you'll need to enable CORS.

**Update `/app/api/contact/route.ts`:**

```typescript
export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  // ... existing code ...
  
  const response = NextResponse.json({ success: true, sent });
  
  // Add CORS headers
  response.headers.set('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', 'https://northpathstrategies.org');
  response.headers.set('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'POST');
  response.headers.set('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type');
  
  return response;
}

// Handle preflight requests
export async function OPTIONS() {
  return new NextResponse(null, {
    status: 200,
    headers: {
      'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': 'https://northpathstrategies.org',
      'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'POST',
      'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type',
    }
  });
}
```

**Or use wildcard for testing (not recommended for production):**
```typescript
response.headers.set('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
```

## üìä Monitoring Your Leads

### Check Email Delivery

**Postmark Dashboard:**
- URL: https://account.postmarkapp.com/servers
- View: Message Streams ‚Üí Activity
- Filter: By date, recipient, status

### Check Database Submissions

**Supabase Dashboard:**
- Navigate to: Table Editor ‚Üí `contact_messages`
- Sort by: `created_at DESC`
- Monitor: `spam_score` for potential spam

**SQL Queries:**
```sql
-- Today's submissions
SELECT COUNT(*) as today_leads
FROM contact_messages
WHERE created_at::date = CURRENT_DATE;

-- High-value leads (urgent timeline)
SELECT *
FROM contact_messages
WHERE message ILIKE '%urgent%'
  OR message ILIKE '%within 2 weeks%'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Spam submissions (filtered)
SELECT COUNT(*) as spam_count
FROM contact_messages
WHERE spam_score >= 10;
```

### Set Up Alerts (Optional)

**Option 1: Postmark Webhooks**
- Configure webhook to notify you instantly on new emails
- POST to Slack, Discord, or custom endpoint

**Option 2: Supabase Triggers**
```sql
-- Create function to notify on new lead
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION notify_new_lead()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Send webhook to Slack, Zapier, etc.
  PERFORM net.http_post(
    'https://your-webhook-url.com',
    '{"text": "New lead from ' || NEW.name || ' at ' || NEW.organization || '"}'
  );
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Attach trigger
CREATE TRIGGER on_new_contact_message
  AFTER INSERT ON contact_messages
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION notify_new_lead();
```

## üö® Known Limitations

1. **Rate Limiting:** 3 submissions/minute per IP address
   - **Impact:** Legitimate users may be blocked if testing repeatedly
   - **Solution:** Adjust rate limit in `/app/api/contact/route.ts` if needed

2. **CORS:** Will need configuration if WordPress domain differs from API
   - **Impact:** Form submission fails with CORS error
   - **Solution:** Add CORS headers as shown in Security section above

3. **Spam Detection:** Current heuristics may need tuning
   - **Impact:** False positives or false negatives
   - **Solution:** Monitor `spam_score` field and adjust thresholds

4. **No Honeypot Field:** Lead gen form doesn't include honeypot
   - **Impact:** More vulnerable to basic spam bots
   - **Solution:** Add hidden `company_website` field (see API code)
