        Organization: Sample K-12 District
    </div>
    
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [Effective Date]</p>
    
    
        <h2>1. Purpose and Scope</h2>
        <p>This policy establishes guidelines for the responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools and systems within Sample K-12 District. It applies to all faculty, staff, students, and contractors who access, use, or implement AI technologies in educational, research, or administrative contexts.</p>
        
    
        <h2>2. K-12 Educational Purpose</h2>
        <p>This policy governs the use of AI technologies in K-12 educational settings to ensure student safety, privacy protection under COPPA, and educational appropriateness. All AI implementations must support pedagogical goals while maintaining compliance with federal and state education regulations.</p>
        
    
        <h2>3. Artificial Intelligence Definition</h2>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence, including but not limited to machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, automated decision-making, and predictive analytics.</p>
        
    
        <h2>4. High-Risk AI System Definition</h2>
        <p>High-Risk AI Systems are those that pose significant potential for adverse impact on student welfare, educational outcomes, privacy rights, or institutional operations. This includes AI systems used for student assessment, disciplinary decisions, college admissions, or processing of sensitive personal data.</p>
        
    
        <h2>5. AI Governance Committee</h2>
        <p>An AI Governance Committee shall be established comprising representatives from IT, Academic Affairs, Legal, Privacy, and Student Services. The committee shall review AI implementations, approve high-risk AI systems, and ensure ongoing compliance with this policy.</p>
        
    
        <h2>6. K-12 Parental Notification</h2>
        <p>Parents and guardians must be notified when AI systems will be used in educational activities involving their children. For AI systems that collect, use, or store student data, written parental consent must be obtained in compliance with COPPA requirements.</p>
        
    
        <h2>7. Student Data Protection</h2>
        <p>AI systems that process student educational records must comply with FERPA requirements. Student data shall not be used for AI training without explicit consent, and all data processing must be limited to legitimate educational purposes.</p>
        
    
        <h2>8. COPPA Compliance for Under-13 Students</h2>
        <p>AI systems used with students under 13 years of age must comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). This includes obtaining verifiable parental consent before collecting personal information and limiting data collection to what is necessary for the educational purpose.</p>
        
    
        <h2>9. AI Risk Assessment Requirement</h2>
        <p>All AI implementations must undergo a risk assessment prior to deployment. The assessment shall evaluate potential impacts on privacy, bias, accuracy, transparency, and educational outcomes. High-risk AI systems require additional review and approval.</p>
        
    
        <h2>10. AI Bias Prevention</h2>
        <p>AI systems must be designed and implemented to minimize bias and ensure fair treatment of all students regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, disability status, or socioeconomic background. Regular bias testing and mitigation measures are required.</p>
        
    
        <h2>11. Academic Integrity and AI Use</h2>
        <p>Students and faculty must disclose the use of AI tools in academic work when required by course policies or institutional guidelines. AI-generated content must be clearly identified, and students remain responsible for the accuracy and originality of their submitted work.</p>
        
    
        <h2>12. AI Vendor Due Diligence</h2>
        <p>Third-party AI vendors must demonstrate compliance with applicable privacy laws, security standards, and educational regulations. Vendor agreements must include data processing addendums, liability provisions, and audit rights.</p>
        
    
        <h2>13. AI Training Requirements</h2>
        <p>All users of AI systems must complete appropriate training on AI ethics, privacy implications, and institutional policies before gaining access. Training shall be updated annually and include emerging best practices.</p>
        
    
        <h2>14. AI System Monitoring</h2>
        <p>AI systems shall be continuously monitored for performance, bias, and compliance with institutional policies. Regular audits, impact assessments, and user feedback collection are required to ensure ongoing effectiveness and safety.</p>
