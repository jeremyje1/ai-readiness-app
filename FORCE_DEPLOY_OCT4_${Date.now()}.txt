FORCE DEPLOYMENT - October 4, 2025 - ${Date.now()}

This file forces Vercel to create a completely new build with:
- New JavaScript bundle hashes
- New chunk file names
- Fresh CDN cache
- No possibility of serving old code

Previous bundles showing:
- 938-77fee557f7a878ac.js (OLD)
- layout-3548995badf52c15.js (OLD)
- page-512ecc3ee6004fe3.js (OLD)

After this deployment, expect NEW hashes.

Commit that should be deployed: 81339fd
Changes included:
- 15-second auth timeouts (not 5)
- Retry logic for failed auth
- Gap analysis auto-creation from assessment
- Dashboard fallback to assessment data
- Better error handling throughout

If you're still seeing the old hashes after this deploys,
the problem is network-level caching (ISP, router, etc.)
