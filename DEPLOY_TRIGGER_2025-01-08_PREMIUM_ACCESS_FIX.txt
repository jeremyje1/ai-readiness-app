Reason: Fix premium dashboard showing mock data and 403 errors

Changes:
- Updated app/api/dashboard/premium-metrics/route.ts
- Now checks both user_profiles and user_payments tables
- Fixes 403 error for users with active payments
- Premium features should work for paid users

Issue Fixed:
- Premium dashboard was returning 403 errors
- Was only checking subscription_status in user_profiles
- Now also checks payment_status in user_payments table
- Users who paid via Stripe can access premium features

Testing:

- Should load without 403 errors
- Should show real data instead of mock data
