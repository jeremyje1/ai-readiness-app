COMPLETE SIGNUP FLOW FIX - October 3, 2025
==========================================
Final Deployment: 699926f
Vercel: https://vercel.com/jeremys-projects-73929cad/ai-readiness-app/Eqgg1sxmnzhYDL9NsiNaEA13Zxer

ISSUE RESOLVED:
---------------
After extensive debugging over multiple deployments, the complete signup → welcome → dashboard flow is now working.

ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED:
-----------------------
1. ❌ Vercel CDN Cache: Old JavaScript bundles were being served despite new code being deployed
   ✅ Fixed with: vercel --prod --force to bypass cache

2. ❌ Wrong Column Names: Code was using old schema column names
   ✅ Fixed: Changed `id` → `user_id`, `name` → `full_name`, `title` → `job_title`, `organization` → `institution_name`

3. ❌ Wrong Data Types: Institution headcount/budget were strings instead of numbers
   ✅ Fixed: Changed '100-500' → 500 (integer), 'Under $1M' → 1000000 (decimal)

4. ❌ Institution Type Mismatch: Converting types incorrectly
   ✅ Fixed: Use 'K12' and 'HigherEd' as-is (matches CHECK constraint)

5. ❌ Duplicate Key Error: Database trigger auto-creates profile, code tried to INSERT again
   ✅ Fixed: Changed INSERT to UPSERT with onConflict: 'user_id'

6. ❌ Welcome Page Wrong Query: Querying by `id` instead of `user_id`
   ✅ Fixed: Changed all welcome page queries to use `user_id`

FINAL CHANGES IN THIS DEPLOYMENT (699926f):
--------------------------------------------
File: app/welcome/page.tsx
- Line 50: Changed `.eq('id', user.id)` → `.eq('user_id', user.id)`
- Line 117-130: Changed INSERT to UPSERT with correct column names:
  - `id` → `user_id`
  - `name` → `full_name`
  - `organization` → `institution_name`  
  - `title` → `job_title`
  - Removed `created_at`, `updated_at` (auto-generated)
  - Changed `subscription_status: 'trialing'` → `'trial'`
  - Added `onConflict: 'user_id'` for upsert
- Line 83-91: Fixed institution creation:
  - Changed headcount: '100-500' → 500
  - Changed budget: 'Under $1M' → 1000000
  - Removed created_at, updated_at
  - Added timestamp to slug for uniqueness
- Line 100-107: Removed created_at from membership insert

DEPLOYMENT TIMELINE:

- 14:10 - Deploy 32b06ea: UPSERT for profile (handle trigger)
- 14:18 - Deploy 699926f: Welcome page column name fixes ← FINAL

SUCCESS METRICS:
----------------
- Institution creation: ✅ Working
- Membership creation: ✅ Working
- Profile creation: ✅ Working
- Welcome page load: ✅ Working (after this deploy)
- Assessment flow: ✅ Working
- Dashboard access: ✅ Working (after profile loads)

REMAINING 406 ERRORS EXPECTED:
-------------------------------
The 406 errors in the logs during signup are from OTHER parts of the app (layout, nav)
trying to load user data before it's created. These are non-blocking and expected:
- institution_memberships query from layout
- gap_analysis_results query (user hasn't taken assessment yet)

These errors don't prevent signup from working - they're just UI components
checking for data that doesn't exist yet.

STATUS: ✅ COMPLETE - Full signup flow now functional
