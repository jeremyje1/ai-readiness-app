# üö® CRITICAL SECURITY INCIDENT - Stripe API Key Compromise

## Incident Summary
**Date**: August 27, 2025  
**Issue**: Stripe live secret key `sk_live_...kUxs` was potentially compromised and accessible on the internet  
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED  

## Actions Taken Immediately

### ‚úÖ 1. Neutralized Local Exposure
- Replaced compromised key in `.env.local` with placeholder
- Replaced compromised key in `.env.local.backup.before-domain-change`  
- Verified `.gitignore` properly excludes environment files

### ‚úÖ 2. Verified Repository Security
- Confirmed .env files are not tracked in git
- Checked git history - no evidence of keys in commit history
- Repository appears secure (keys were never committed)

## üö® CRITICAL ACTIONS YOU MUST TAKE NOW

### 1. **Immediately Create New API Keys**
1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys)
2. **Create new restricted secret key** with minimal required permissions:
   - `write:checkout_sessions`
   - `write:payment_intents` 
   - `read:payment_intents`
   - `write:subscriptions`
   - `read:subscriptions`
3. **Delete/Revoke the compromised key** `sk_live_...kUxs`
4. Update your environment variables with the new key

### 2. **Update Environment Variables**
Replace in your local `.env.local`:
```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_live_YOUR_NEW_SECRET_KEY_HERE"
```

### 3. **Update Production Environment** 
Update environment variables in:
- **Vercel Dashboard**: Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
- Any other deployment platforms you use

### 4. **Review Stripe Activity**
1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Logs](https://dashboard.stripe.com/logs)
2. Review all API calls from the last 7 days
3. Look for any unauthorized charges or suspicious activity
4. Check for unusual payment patterns or new customers

### 5. **Audit Recent Transactions**
1. Review all payments/subscriptions created recently
2. Verify all customers are legitimate
3. Check for any refunds or chargebacks

## Potential Attack Vectors

### How the key might have been exposed:
1. **Public repository** (ruled out - keys not in git)
2. **Environment variables in deployment logs**
3. **Client-side code accidentally including server keys**
4. **Third-party service with access to environment**
5. **Development/staging environment exposure**

## Security Recommendations

### Immediate (Today):
- [ ] Create new restricted Stripe API keys
- [ ] Update all environment variables  
- [ ] Audit Stripe transaction logs
- [ ] Monitor for suspicious activity

### Short-term (This week):
- [ ] Implement API key rotation schedule
- [ ] Set up Stripe webhook signature verification
- [ ] Add request logging and monitoring
- [ ] Review all third-party integrations

### Long-term (This month):
- [ ] Implement secrets management system (AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
- [ ] Set up automated security scanning
- [ ] Create incident response playbook
- [ ] Regular security audits

## Prevention Measures

### Code-level Security:
```javascript
// ‚úÖ Good: Environment variable validation
if (!process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY) {
    throw new Error('Missing STRIPE_SECRET_KEY');
}

// ‚úÖ Good: Use restricted keys with minimal permissions
const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, {
    apiVersion: '2025-06-30.basil'
});

// ‚ùå Never: Hardcode secrets
const stripe = new Stripe('sk_live_actual_key_here'); // NEVER DO THIS
```

### Environment Security:
- Use different keys for development/staging/production
- Implement key rotation every 90 days
- Monitor API usage patterns
- Set up alerts for unusual activity

## Monitoring Setup

After securing your new keys, implement:
```javascript
// Add request logging
stripe.on('request', (request) => {
    console.log('Stripe API Request:', {
        method: request.method,
        path: request.path,
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    });
});
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è NEXT STEPS CHECKLIST

- [ ] **URGENT**: Create new Stripe API keys (restricted permissions)
- [ ] **URGENT**: Update all environment variables
- [ ] **URGENT**: Review Stripe transaction logs
- [ ] Verify webhook signatures are properly validated
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Schedule regular security reviews

**Time-sensitive**: Complete the first 3 items within the next hour to prevent further potential abuse.
