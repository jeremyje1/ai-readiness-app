# ðŸš€ Apply Demo Leads Migration - Manual Steps

## Quick Instructions

Since the Supabase CLI `db execute` command isn't available, here's the fastest way to apply the migration:

### Step 1: Open Supabase SQL Editor

Click this link to go directly to your project's SQL editor:
```
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/jocigzsthcpspxfdfxae/sql/new
```

**Project**: AI Readiness Assessment (us-east-2)

### Step 2: Copy Migration SQL

The migration SQL is located at:
```
supabase/migrations/20251017_create_demo_leads_table.sql
```

Or copy from below:

```sql
-- Create demo_leads table for Education AI Blueprint marketing demo
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS demo_leads (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  
  -- Lead Information
  first_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  last_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  institution_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  institution_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  role TEXT NOT NULL,
  
  -- Tracking & Attribution
  ip_address TEXT,
  user_agent TEXT,
  referrer TEXT,
  utm_source TEXT,
  utm_medium TEXT,
  utm_campaign TEXT,
  utm_term TEXT,
  utm_content TEXT,
  
  -- Assessment Data
  responses JSONB,
  overall_score INTEGER,
  readiness_level TEXT,
  category_scores JSONB,
  quick_wins JSONB,
  estimated_impact JSONB,
  
  -- Lead Qualification
  lead_qualification TEXT CHECK (lead_qualification IN ('HOT', 'WARM', 'COLD')),
  
  -- Follow-up Tracking
  contacted BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  contacted_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  contacted_by TEXT,
  demo_scheduled BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  demo_scheduled_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  demo_completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  demo_completed_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  converted_to_customer BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  converted_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  
  -- Notes
  notes TEXT,
  
  -- Timestamps
  started_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  completed_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Create indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_demo_leads_email ON demo_leads(email);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_demo_leads_created_at ON demo_leads(created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_demo_leads_completed_at ON demo_leads(completed_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_demo_leads_lead_qualification ON demo_leads(lead_qualification);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_demo_leads_contacted ON demo_leads(contacted) WHERE contacted = FALSE;
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_demo_leads_demo_scheduled ON demo_leads(demo_scheduled) WHERE demo_scheduled = TRUE;
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_demo_leads_institution_type ON demo_leads(institution_type);

-- Create updated_at trigger
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_demo_leads_updated_at()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  NEW.updated_at = NOW();
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER demo_leads_updated_at
  BEFORE UPDATE ON demo_leads
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION update_demo_leads_updated_at();

-- Add RLS policies
ALTER TABLE demo_leads ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Allow service role to do everything
CREATE POLICY "Service role can do everything with demo_leads"
  ON demo_leads
  FOR ALL
  TO service_role
  USING (true)
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- Allow authenticated users to read their own leads (by email)
CREATE POLICY "Users can read their own demo leads"
  ON demo_leads
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (email = (auth.jwt() -> 'email')::text);

-- Allow anonymous users to create leads (for public demo form)
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can create demo leads"
  ON demo_leads
  FOR INSERT
  TO anon
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- Create view for sales dashboard
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW demo_leads_dashboard AS
SELECT
  id,
  first_name || ' ' || last_name AS full_name,
  email,
  institution_name,
  institution_type,
  role,
  overall_score,
  readiness_level,
  lead_qualification,
  contacted,
  demo_scheduled,
  converted_to_customer,
  started_at,
  completed_at,
  CASE
    WHEN completed_at IS NOT NULL THEN 'Completed'
    WHEN started_at IS NOT NULL THEN 'In Progress'
    ELSE 'New'
  END AS status,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (completed_at - started_at)) / 60 AS completion_time_minutes,
  utm_source,
  utm_campaign
FROM demo_leads
WHERE completed_at IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY completed_at DESC;

-- Grant access to view
GRANT SELECT ON demo_leads_dashboard TO service_role;
GRANT SELECT ON demo_leads_dashboard TO authenticated;

-- Add comments for documentation
COMMENT ON TABLE demo_leads IS 'Stores leads captured from Education AI Blueprint demo assessment';
COMMENT ON COLUMN demo_leads.responses IS 'JSON object mapping question IDs to answer values (0-4)';
COMMENT ON COLUMN demo_leads.category_scores IS 'JSON object with category names and percentage scores';
COMMENT ON COLUMN demo_leads.quick_wins IS 'JSON array of personalized quick win recommendations';
COMMENT ON COLUMN demo_leads.estimated_impact IS 'JSON object with cost savings, time saved, and efficiency gain estimates';
COMMENT ON COLUMN demo_leads.lead_qualification IS 'HOT (high score + decision maker), WARM (medium score or high score), COLD (low score)';
```

### Step 3: Run the Migration

1. Paste the SQL into the editor
2. Click the **"Run"** button (or press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter)
3. Wait for success message

### Step 4: Verify Installation

Run this query to verify the table was created:

```sql
-- Check table structure
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'demo_leads'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;

-- Check indexes
SELECT indexname, indexdef
FROM pg_indexes
WHERE tablename = 'demo_leads';

-- Check RLS policies
SELECT policyname, cmd, roles
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'demo_leads';

-- Test insert (should work)
SELECT 1 as test;
```

### Step 5: Test with Sample Data (Optional)

```sql
-- Insert a test lead
INSERT INTO demo_leads (
  first_name,
  last_name,
  email,
  institution_name,
  institution_type,
  role
) VALUES (
  'Test',
  'User',
  'test@example.com',
  'Test University',
  'Four-Year College/University',
  'CIO/CTO/Technology Director'
) RETURNING id, email, created_at;

-- Verify it was created
SELECT * FROM demo_leads WHERE email = 'test@example.com';

-- Clean up test data
DELETE FROM demo_leads WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
```

## âœ… Success Indicators

You'll know it worked when:
- âœ… Query returns "Success. No rows returned" or similar
- âœ… `demo_leads` table appears in Table Editor
- âœ… 7 indexes are created
- âœ… 3 RLS policies are active
- âœ… `demo_leads_dashboard` view is created
- âœ… Test insert works without errors

---

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Error: "relation demo_leads already exists"
**Solution**: Table already exists. Skip migration or drop and recreate:
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS demo_leads CASCADE;
-- Then run the migration again
```

### Error: "permission denied"
**Solution**: Make sure you're logged into Supabase dashboard and have admin access to the project.

### Error: "syntax error near..."
**Solution**: Make sure you copied the ENTIRE migration SQL, including all comments.

---

## ðŸ“Š Next Steps After Migration

Once the migration is applied:

1. **Deploy API routes**: `vercel --prod`
2. **Test demo page**: Visit the demo HTML
3. **Verify emails**: Complete an assessment
4. **Check database**: Query `demo_leads` table

See `QUICK_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for complete deployment instructions.
