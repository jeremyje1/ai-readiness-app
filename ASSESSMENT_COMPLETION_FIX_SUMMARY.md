- **Impact**: Users now see their results immediately after completion

### **2. Enhanced Results API & Display**
**Created**: `/app/api/ai-readiness/results/[id]/route.ts`
- Real-time assessment result retrieval
- Fallback to comprehensive sample data if database unavailable
- Proper error handling and TypeScript compliance

**Enhanced**: `/app/ai-readiness/results/page.tsx`
- Added TypeScript interface for algorithm results
- Displays patent-pending algorithm suite results prominently
- Shows AIRIXâ„¢, AIRSâ„¢, AICSâ„¢, AIMSâ„¢, AIPSâ„¢, AIBSâ„¢ analysis
- Visual factor breakdowns with progress bars
- Clear labeling of proprietary technology

### **3. Upgraded AI Readiness Engine**
**Enhanced**: `/lib/aiReadinessEngine.ts`
- Proper algorithm result structure with score, level, and factors
- Overall score calculation from algorithm outputs
- Maturity level determination (Leading/Advanced/Progressing/Developing/Emerging)
- Domain score calculation
- Comprehensive recommendation generation
- Robust fallback handling for missing algorithms

### **4. Enhanced API Response Structure**
**Enhanced**: `/app/api/ai-readiness/submit/route.ts`
- Include algorithm results in response payload
- Enhanced email notification with results URL
- Proper score extraction from engine results
- Comprehensive initial results summary
