## Critical Issue: Demo Form Breaking in Production

**Time:** October 18, 2025 @ 11:20 AM  
**Status:** ðŸ”´ BLOCKING ALL DEMO REGISTRATIONS

---

## The Problem

Your demo registration form is **failing with 500 errors** because the database is missing the `phone` column that the API expects.

**Error Message:**
```
Failed to update existing demo lead
"Could not find the 'phone' column of 'demo_leads' in the schema cache"
```

---

## âš¡ IMMEDIATE FIX (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Open Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: `jocigzsthcpspxfdfxae`

### Step 2: Run This SQL
1. Click **SQL Editor** in left sidebar
2. Click **New Query**
3. **Copy and paste this EXACTLY:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE demo_leads ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS phone TEXT;
```

4. Click **Run** (or press Cmd+Enter / Ctrl+Enter)

### Step 3: Verify Success
You should see: `Success. No rows returned`

That's it! The demo form will work immediately.

## Verify It's Fixed

1. Visit: https://aiblueprint.educationaiblueprint.com/demo
2. Fill out the form completely
3. Click "Start the interactive demo"
4. Should redirect to dashboard (not error anymore)

## What I've Already Done

âœ… Created migration files for future deployments  
âœ… Updated base migration to include phone column  
âœ… Pushed code fixes to GitHub  
âœ… Documented the issue  

**What's LEFT:** You need to run that one SQL command in Supabase (above).

---

## Why This Happened

The `phone` field was added to the intake form and API, but the database migration was never run in production. The code expected the column to exist, but it didn't.
