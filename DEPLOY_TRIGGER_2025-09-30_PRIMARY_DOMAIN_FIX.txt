DEPLOYMENT TRIGGER: Primary Domain Redirect Fix
==============================================

Date: September 30, 2025  
Commit: 6c87585
Branch: main

CRITICAL FIX: Domain Redirect Configuration
------------------------------------------
Fixed the redirect issue where aiblueprint.k12aiblueprint.com was incorrectly 
redirecting to aiblueprint.higheredaiblueprint.com/ai-readiness

CHANGES MADE:
------------
1. middleware.ts:
   - Changed primary domain from higheredaiblueprint.com to k12aiblueprint.com
   - higheredaiblueprint.com is now treated as a legacy domain that redirects to k12
   - Removed k12aiblueprint.com from the legacy redirect list

2. next.config.js:
   - Removed automatic redirect from / to /ai-readiness
   - Root domain will now handle its own routing

3. app/page.tsx:
   - Changed root page to redirect to /start instead of /ai-readiness
   - This allows users to choose between K-12 and Higher Ed

REDIRECT BEHAVIOR AFTER FIX:
---------------------------
- aiblueprint.k12aiblueprint.com → NO REDIRECT (primary domain)
- aiblueprint.higheredaiblueprint.com → Redirects to k12aiblueprint.com
- Root path (/) → Redirects to /start (user choice page)

VERIFICATION STEPS:
------------------
1. Visit https://aiblueprint.k12aiblueprint.com/
   - Should NOT redirect to higheredaiblueprint.com
   - Should show the /start page for user choice
   
2. Visit https://aiblueprint.higheredaiblueprint.com/
   - SHOULD redirect to k12aiblueprint.com

3. Test all navigation links work correctly on the unified domain

DEPLOYMENT NOTES:
----------------
This fix ensures k12aiblueprint.com is the unified platform domain
where both K-12 and Higher Ed users access the same application.
