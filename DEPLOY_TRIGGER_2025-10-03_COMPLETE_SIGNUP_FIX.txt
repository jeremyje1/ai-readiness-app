CRITICAL FIX SUMMARY:
--------------------
Fixed complete signup flow by creating profile and institution immediately 
instead of relying on non-functioning webhook.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION:
The signup process was:
1. Creating auth user successfully ✅
2. Skipping profile creation (relying on webhook) ❌  
3. Redirecting to welcome page
4. Welcome page getting 406 errors because no profile/institution exists
5. User stuck in infinite retry loop

ERROR LOGS OBSERVED:
- "Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 406 ()"
- "No institution membership found for user"
- "Profile not found yet, will retry..."
- Multiple retries then redirect to dashboard with no data

ROOT CAUSE:
The signup flow was depending on a Stripe webhook to create profiles, but:
- Webhook may not be configured or functioning
- Race condition between signup and profile creation
- 406 errors indicate RLS policies rejecting queries for non-existent records

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
Modified signup process to create everything immediately:

1. **Institution Creation**
   - Creates institution with organization name
   - Unique slug with timestamp to avoid conflicts
   - Sets default values for headcount, budget, type

2. **Institution Membership**  
   - Links user to institution with admin role
   - Ensures user has institution context

3. **User Profile**
   - Creates profile with all signup data
   - Sets 7-day trial period
   - Includes all metadata

CHANGES MADE:
- app/get-started/page.tsx - Restored profile creation in signup flow

USER FLOW NOW:
1. User fills signup form
2. Supabase auth creates account
3. System immediately creates:
   - Institution
   - Institution membership
   - User profile
4. Welcome email sent
5. Redirect to welcome page (with all data ready)
6. No 406 errors, smooth flow to dashboard

TESTING CHECKLIST:
✅ Signup with new email
✅ Verify institution created in database
✅ Verify institution_memberships record created
✅ Verify user_profiles record created  
✅ Verify no 406 errors
✅ Verify smooth flow to dashboard
✅ Verify welcome email sent

ALL FIXES IN THIS DEPLOYMENT:
1. Welcome page infinite loop fix
2. Build failures fixed (OpenAI & Stripe APIs)
3. Assessment flow with document upload  
4. Institution membership auto-creation
5. Complete signup flow fix (THIS FIX)
