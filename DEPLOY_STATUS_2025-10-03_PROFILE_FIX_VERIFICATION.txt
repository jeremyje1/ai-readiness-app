DEPLOYMENT STATUS - PROFILE CREATION FIX
========================================

ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
-----------------
Previous deployment (commit 488b575) was deploying OLD CODE that still had:
```
console.log('‚è≠Ô∏è Skipping manual profile creation (webhook will handle it)');
```

This is why users were still getting 406 errors even after I "fixed" it.

ROOT CAUSE:
The code fix (commit a780ca4) was in the git history but Vercel was somehow
deploying an older version. This created confusion where locally the code
looked correct but production was running old code.

RESOLUTION:
Created empty commit (7e580ac) to force Vercel to do a fresh deployment
with the correct code that includes profile creation.

WHAT THE FIX DOES:
------------------
When a user signs up, the system now immediately:

1. Creates Institution
   - Uses organization name or email domain
   - Unique slug to avoid conflicts
   - Default values for headcount, budget, type

2. Creates Institution Membership  
   - Links user to institution
   - Assigns admin role
   - Activates membership

3. Creates User Profile
   - All signup data included
   - 7-day trial configured
   - Proper timestamps

CODE LOCATION:
app/get-started/page.tsx (lines ~136-195)

VERIFICATION STEPS:
-------------------
After deployment completes, verify:

1. Sign up with new email
2. Check browser console - should see:
   ‚úì "üìù Creating user profile and institution..."
   ‚úì "‚úÖ Institution created: <id>"
   ‚úì "‚úÖ Institution membership created"
   ‚úì "‚úÖ Profile created"
   
3. Should NOT see:
   ‚úó "‚è≠Ô∏è Skipping manual profile creation (webhook will handle it)"
   ‚úó 406 errors
   ‚úó "No institution membership found"

4. User should smoothly proceed to dashboard

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
------------------
Signup ‚Üí Welcome (with profile ready) ‚Üí Dashboard
No 406 errors, no retry loops, no getting stuck

This should be the FINAL fix that actually works in production.
