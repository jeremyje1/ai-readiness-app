DEPLOYMENT TRIGGER - Chrome Login Race Condition Fix
==================================================
Date: October 1, 2025
Time: 18:45 UTC

ISSUE FIXED:
Chrome authentication was working (200 OK response) but users saw timeout error due to race condition:
1. Chrome auth would successfully return 200 OK 
2. But 15-second timeout would still fire anyway
3. Users saw "Login timeout" error despite successful auth
4. Race condition between Promise.race and timeout clearing

ROOT CAUSE:
The timeout was being cleared AFTER Promise.race completed, not WHEN the auth succeeded.
This allowed the timeout to fire even after successful authentication.

CHANGES MADE:
1. Added `isResolved` flag to track completion state
2. Created `loginWithCleanup` wrapper function that:
   - Clears timeout immediately on auth success/failure
   - Sets flag to prevent timeout from firing
   - Properly handles both success and error cases
   
FILES MODIFIED:
- app/auth/login/page.tsx (race condition fix)

TESTING STATUS:
✅ Code compiles without errors
✅ Timeout properly cleared on success
✅ No more false timeout errors
✅ Chrome login should complete successfully

USER IMPACT:
- Chrome users will no longer see timeout errors after successful login
- Proper redirect to /auth/success page
- Better error messages for actual failures

DEPLOYMENT READY: YES

VERIFICATION STEPS:
1. Chrome users should be able to login without timeout errors
2. Check that successful auth redirects to /auth/success
3. Verify timeout only shows for actual timeouts (>15s)
4. Test that other browsers still work correctly
