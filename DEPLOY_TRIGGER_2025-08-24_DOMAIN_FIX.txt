CRITICAL DOMAIN REDIRECT FIX - Deploy 2025-08-24

ISSUE RESOLVED: Higher Ed users redirected to K-12 domain after checkout

FIXES IMPLEMENTED:
✅ Domain-aware Stripe checkout logic (unified-checkout/route.ts)
✅ Domain-aware client-side redirects (success page, password setup, dashboard)
✅ New domain utility functions for consistent URL generation
✅ Subscription progress API URL decoding fix

TECHNICAL CHANGES:
1. buildCheckoutUrls() now detects host header and uses appropriate canonical domain
2. All router.push() calls replaced with navigateToDomainAwarePath() for cross-domain nav
3. Added /lib/domain-utils.ts for consistent domain detection and URL generation
4. Fixed URL encoding issue in subscription progress API

TESTING REQUIRED:
- Higher Ed checkout flow: aiblueprint.higheredaiblueprint.com → Stripe → back to Higher Ed domain
- K-12 checkout flow: aiblueprint.k12aiblueprint.com → Stripe → back to K-12 domain
- Dashboard redirects maintain domain context throughout user journey

DEPLOY: Ready for production deployment
BUILD: ✅ Successful compilation
