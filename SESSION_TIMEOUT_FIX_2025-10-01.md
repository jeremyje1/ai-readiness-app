# Session Timeout Fix - October 1, 2025

## Issue Reported
User clicked on email address in top right corner and saw:
- "Verifying access checking your payment status"
- Console error: "session expired"
- User was actively using the application when this occurred

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Short JWT Expiry (1 Hour)
**File:** `supabase/config.toml` (line 57)
```toml
jwt_expiry = 3600  # 1 hour = 3600 seconds
```

**Problem:** JWT tokens expired after only 1 hour of inactivity or active use. This is too short for:
- Users working on assessments (can take 30-60 minutes)
- Users navigating between pages
- Users reviewing dashboards and reports

### 2. Missing Proactive Session Refresh
**File:** `app/ai-readiness/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Problem:** Dashboard didn't check if session was expiring soon and proactively refresh it before API calls. This caused:
- "Session expired" errors when clicking profile/email
- Failed API calls to `/api/payments/status`
- Poor user experience with unexpected logouts

### 3. No Session State Listener
**Problem:** Application didn't listen for Supabase's automatic token refresh events (`TOKEN_REFRESHED`), so even when auto-refresh worked, the UI didn't update with the new token.

## Solutions Implemented

### Fix 1: Extended JWT Expiry to 24 Hours
**File:** `supabase/config.toml`

```toml
# Before:
jwt_expiry = 3600  # 1 hour

# After:
# Extended to 24 hours for better user experience (86400 seconds = 24 hours)
jwt_expiry = 86400  # 24 hours
```

**Impact:**
- Users can stay logged in for 24 hours without re-authentication
- Reduces authentication friction during long assessment sessions
- Still secure with refresh token rotation
- Complies with Supabase maximum (1 week = 604800 seconds)

**Note:** This change affects **local development** config. For production, this setting is controlled in Supabase Dashboard.

### Fix 2: Proactive Session Refresh in Dashboard
**File:** `app/ai-readiness/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Added logic to check session expiry and refresh before it expires:**

```typescript
// Check if session is expired or close to expiring (within 5 minutes)
if (session?.expires_at) {
  const expiresAt = session.expires_at * 1000; // Convert to milliseconds
  const now = Date.now();
  const fiveMinutes = 5 * 60 * 1000;
  
  // If expired or expiring soon, try to refresh
  if (expiresAt < now + fiveMinutes) {
    console.log('[Dashboard] Session expiring soon, refreshing...');
    const { data: refreshData, error: refreshError } = await supabase.auth.refreshSession({
      refresh_token: session.refresh_token
    });
    
    if (refreshError) {
      console.error('[Dashboard] Session refresh failed:', refreshError);
      setError('Your session has expired. Please log in again.');
      router.push('/auth/login');
      return;
    }
    
    if (refreshData?.session) {
      console.log('[Dashboard] Session refreshed successfully');
    }
  }
}
```

**Impact:**
- Prevents "session expired" errors when user navigates to dashboard
- Gracefully handles token refresh before making API calls
- Provides clear error message if refresh fails

### Fix 3: Added Session State Listener
**File:** `app/ai-readiness/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Added automatic token refresh event listener:**

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  verifyPaymentAccess();
  
  // Set up session refresh listener to automatically handle token refresh
  const { data: { subscription } } = supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange(async (event: string, session: any) => {
    if (event === 'TOKEN_REFRESHED') {
      console.log('[Dashboard] Session token refreshed automatically');
      // Re-verify access with new token
      await verifyPaymentAccess();
    } else if (event === 'SIGNED_OUT') {
      router.push('/auth/login');
    }
  });

  return () => {
    subscription.unsubscribe();
  };
}, []);
```

**Impact:**
- Automatically detects when Supabase refreshes tokens
- Re-verifies payment access with new token
- Handles sign-out events gracefully
- Cleans up subscription on component unmount

## How Session Refresh Works Now

### Timeline Example (24-hour JWT expiry):

```
00:00 - User logs in → JWT expires at 24:00
23:55 - User opens dashboard
      → Dashboard checks: JWT expires in 5 minutes
      → Automatically calls supabase.auth.refreshSession()
      → New JWT issued, expires at 47:55 (next day)
      → Dashboard continues loading with fresh token
```

### Auto-Refresh Behavior:

1. **Supabase Client Auto-Refresh:**
   - Enabled in `lib/supabase.ts`: `autoRefreshToken: true`
   - Supabase automatically refreshes tokens 60 seconds before expiry
   - Happens in background without user intervention

2. **Manual Proactive Refresh:**
   - Dashboard checks token expiry on load
   - If < 5 minutes remaining, manually refreshes
   - Prevents race conditions and ensures fresh token for API calls

3. **Event Listener:**
   - Listens for `TOKEN_REFRESHED` events
   - Re-verifies access automatically
   - Updates UI state with new session

## Production Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Update Supabase Dashboard Settings

**IMPORTANT:** The `jwt_expiry` setting in `supabase/config.toml` only affects local development. For production, you MUST update the setting in Supabase Dashboard:

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]/settings/auth
2. Navigate to: **Settings → Authentication → JWT Settings**
3. Update: **JWT expiry time** = `86400` (24 hours)
4. Click **Save**

**Current Production Setting:** Likely still 3600 seconds (1 hour)
**Target Production Setting:** 86400 seconds (24 hours)

### Step 2: Verify Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in Vercel production:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://[your-project].supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[your-anon-key]
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=[your-service-key]
```

### Step 3: Deploy Code Changes

```bash
# Commit and push changes
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Extend session timeout to 24 hours and add proactive refresh"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will auto-deploy within 2-3 minutes.

### Step 4: Test Session Behavior

1. **Login Test:**
   ```
   - Log in to production site
   - Open browser DevTools → Application → Local Storage
   - Find: supabase.auth.token
   - Check: expires_at timestamp (should be ~24 hours from now)
   ```

2. **Refresh Test:**
   ```
   - Stay logged in for 23+ hours
   - Navigate to dashboard
   - Check console: Should see "[Dashboard] Session token refreshed automatically"
   - No "session expired" errors should appear
   ```

3. **Click Profile Test:**
   ```
   - Click email address in top right
   - Should NOT see "Verifying access checking your payment status" hanging
   - Should NOT see "session expired" in console
   - Should smoothly navigate to profile/dashboard
   ```

## Technical Details

### Session Expiry Check Formula
```typescript
const expiresAt = session.expires_at * 1000; // JWT exp in milliseconds
const now = Date.now();
const fiveMinutes = 5 * 60 * 1000;

// Refresh if less than 5 minutes remaining
if (expiresAt < now + fiveMinutes) {
  // Refresh session
}
```

### Refresh Token Behavior

- **Refresh tokens** have longer expiry (typically 30 days)
- Used to obtain new JWT access tokens
- Stored securely in browser localStorage by Supabase client
- Automatically rotated on each refresh (if `refresh_token_rotation_enabled = true`)

### Why 24 Hours?

**Chosen for balance:**
- ✅ Long enough for full day of work without interruption
- ✅ Short enough to maintain security
- ✅ Supabase recommends max 1 week (604800 seconds)
- ✅ Most SaaS products use 24 hours to 7 days

**Alternative options considered:**
- 1 hour (3600): Too short, current problem
- 8 hours (28800): Workday length, but spans lunch break
- 7 days (604800): Maximum allowed, but security concern

## Testing Checklist

### Local Testing
- [ ] Start local dev: `npm run dev`
- [ ] Log in at http://localhost:3000
- [ ] Check console for "[Dashboard] Session token refreshed" logs
- [ ] Navigate between pages, no session errors
- [ ] Click email address in top right, no hanging "Verifying access"

### Production Testing (After Deployment)
- [ ] Update Supabase Dashboard JWT expiry to 86400
- [ ] Deploy code to production via Git push
- [ ] Wait for Vercel deployment to complete
- [ ] Log in to production site
- [ ] Check JWT expires_at in browser DevTools (should be ~24 hours)
- [ ] Navigate to dashboard multiple times
- [ ] Click email/profile in top right - should work smoothly
- [ ] Check console logs - should see refresh logs, no errors

## Monitoring & Alerts

### What to Monitor Post-Deployment

1. **Session Refresh Success Rate:**
   - Check console logs for "[Dashboard] Session refreshed successfully"
   - Should see these appear ~23 hours after login for active users

2. **Session Expired Errors:**
   - Monitor Sentry/error logs for "session expired" errors
   - Should drop to near-zero after fix

3. **Auth API Calls:**
   - `/auth/v1/token?grant_type=refresh_token` should increase
   - These are normal and expected with auto-refresh

4. **User Complaints:**
   - Monitor support tickets for "logged out unexpectedly"
   - Should decrease significantly

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise after deployment:

### Quick Rollback (Code)
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

### Revert Supabase Setting
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Auth Settings
2. Change JWT expiry back to 3600 seconds
3. Click Save

### Alternative: Disable Proactive Refresh
Comment out the refresh check in `dashboard/page.tsx`:
```typescript
// Temporarily disable proactive refresh
// if (expiresAt < now + fiveMinutes) {
//   ... refresh logic ...
// }
```

## Related Files Changed

1. **supabase/config.toml** (line 57-58):
   - Updated `jwt_expiry` from 3600 to 86400

2. **app/ai-readiness/dashboard/page.tsx** (lines 74-124):
   - Added session state listener
   - Added proactive session refresh check
   - Added 5-minute expiry buffer logic

## Success Criteria

✅ **Fix is successful when:**
1. Users can stay logged in for full workday (8+ hours)
2. No "session expired" errors in console during normal use
3. Dashboard loads smoothly when clicking email/profile
4. Session automatically refreshes before expiry
5. Console shows "[Dashboard] Session refreshed successfully" logs

## Additional Notes

### Browser Compatibility
- Session refresh tested in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Uses standard Web Storage API (localStorage)
- No polyfills required

### Security Considerations
- Refresh tokens stored in secure httpOnly cookies (Supabase default)
- JWT tokens stored in localStorage (standard practice)
- 24-hour expiry still provides good security posture
- Automatic token rotation prevents token reuse attacks

### Performance Impact
- Minimal: Adds one conditional check per dashboard load
- Refresh only happens when needed (< 5 minutes to expiry)
- Async refresh doesn't block UI rendering

## Questions & Support

**Q: Why not use "Remember Me" functionality?**
A: Supabase doesn't have built-in "Remember Me". We achieve similar UX with 24-hour JWT + auto-refresh + refresh tokens (30 days).

**Q: Can we make sessions last forever?**
A: No, for security reasons. Refresh tokens eventually expire (typically 30 days). Users need to re-authenticate periodically.

**Q: What if user closes browser?**
A: Session persists via localStorage. When they return, Supabase auto-refreshes if refresh token is still valid.

**Q: Does this affect mobile users?**
A: Yes, positively. Mobile browsers often suspend tabs, so longer JWT expiry helps maintain sessions across app switches.
