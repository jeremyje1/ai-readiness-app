- Production URL: https://aiblueprint.k12aiblueprint.com
- Deployment ID: ai-readiness-kb8ui3zh8 (Ready - 8 minutes ago)
- Build Status: Successfully deployed

🎯 ENHANCED LOGOUT BUTTON FEATURES:

🔍 TO TEST THE LOGOUT BUTTON:
1. Navigate to: https://aiblueprint.k12aiblueprint.com/auth/login
2. Log in with your credentials (jeremy.estrella@gmail.com)
3. Once authenticated, you'll see the enhanced logout button in the header
4. The button appears with red styling and logout icon in the top-right

📋 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
- Desktop: Red button with icon in top-right header
- Mobile: Full-width red button in mobile menu
- Functionality: Calls supabase.auth.signOut() and redirects to home
- Styling: bg-red-50 border-red-200 text-red-700 with hover effects

⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE:
The logout button only appears when you're authenticated. From the HAR file, 
you're currently being redirected to login, which means you're not logged in.
This is expected behavior - the button will appear after successful authentication.
