# NUCLEAR CACHE PURGE CHECKLIST - October 4, 2025

## Issue: Signup hangs after form submission

## Solution Deployed:
‚úÖ Added 10-second timeout to auth signup
‚úÖ Added 5-second timeout to profile creation
‚úÖ Force redirect if any operation hangs
‚úÖ Fallback mechanisms at every step

## CRITICAL: You Must Execute Nuclear Cache Purge

### Step 1: Vercel CDN Cache (MOST IMPORTANT)
1. Go to: **Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí [Your Project] ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí CDN Cache**
2. Click: **"Purge Cache"**
3. Select: **"Delete content"** (NOT invalidate - we want nuclear option)
4. Tags field: **Leave EMPTY** (this purges everything)
5. Click: **"Purge"**
6. Wait for confirmation

### Step 2: Vercel Data Cache
1. Go to: **Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí [Your Project] ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Data Cache**
2. Click: **"Purge Cache"**
3. Confirm deletion

### Step 3: Wait for New Deployment
1. Go to: **Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí [Your Project] ‚Üí Deployments**
2. Wait for the new deployment to show "Ready" (commit: fa24139)
3. Should take 2-3 minutes

### Step 4: Test in Incognito
1. Open **NEW** incognito/private window
2. Navigate to your site
3. Go to `/get-started`
4. Fill out the form
5. Click Submit
6. **Expected behavior:** 
   - Should redirect to `/welcome` within 10 seconds maximum
   - If database is slow, you'll see console warning but still redirect
   - No more infinite hangs

### Step 5: If Still Hanging
Open browser DevTools (F12) and check:

**Console Tab - Look for:**
```
üöÄ Starting signup process...
‚è∞ Timestamp: [should be current time]
üî• NUCLEAR CACHE BUST - October 4, 2025
```

If you DON'T see these logs, the cache hasn't cleared. Do this:
1. Hard refresh: **Ctrl+Shift+R** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd+Shift+R** (Mac)
2. Or right-click refresh button ‚Üí "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
3. Or clear ALL browser data for the site

**Network Tab - Look for:**
- Any 406 errors = RLS policy issue (different problem)
- Any 500 errors = Server error (check Vercel logs)
- Requests hanging = Database timeout (but should redirect anyway now)

### Step 6: Nuclear Browser Cache Clear
If STILL not working after Steps 1-5:
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application tab ‚Üí Storage
3. Click "Clear site data"
4. Check ALL boxes
5. Click "Clear site data"
6. Close and reopen browser
7. Test again in incognito

### What Changed in the Code:
```typescript
// BEFORE (could hang forever):
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signUp(...);

// AFTER (max 10 seconds):
const result = await Promise.race([
  supabase.auth.signUp(...),
  timeout(10000)
]);
// If timeout, redirects anyway
```

### Expected Timeline:
- Auth signup: 1-3 seconds normally
- Profile creation: 1-2 seconds normally  
- Total redirect: 2-5 seconds typical
- Maximum wait: 10 seconds before force redirect
- **Hang time: ZERO** (impossible to hang now)

### Success Indicators:
‚úÖ Console shows "üî• NUCLEAR CACHE BUST - October 4, 2025"
‚úÖ Signup completes or times out within 10 seconds
‚úÖ User redirected to /welcome page
‚úÖ No infinite loading state

### Failure Indicators (Need More Investigation):
‚ùå Console shows old timestamps (cache not cleared)
‚ùå Console doesn't show nuclear cache bust marker
‚ùå Still hangs beyond 10 seconds (impossible unless JS not loading)
‚ùå White screen (JavaScript not loading at all)

### Emergency Rollback:
If this doesn't work, the issue is NOT the signup code. Possible causes:
1. CDN not serving new code (wait 5-10 minutes for propagation)
2. Service Worker caching old code (clear in DevTools ‚Üí Application)
3. Browser extension blocking requests
4. Network/firewall issue
5. Supabase itself is down (check status.supabase.com)

## Post-Purge Monitoring:
After successful purge and test:
1. Check Vercel Function logs during signup
2. Check Supabase logs for any errors
3. Verify user_profiles table has new entries
4. Test with multiple browsers
5. Test with different email addresses
