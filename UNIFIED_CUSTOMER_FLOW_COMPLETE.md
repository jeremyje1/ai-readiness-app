# Unified Customer Flow Implementation - Complete

## Overview
I've completely redesigned the customer journey to provide a single, professional onboarding experience where users can create their account, set their password, and get started immediately without email verification delays.

## New Customer Flow

### Single Entry Point: `/get-started`
All signup/login flows now go through a unified page at `/get-started` that:
- Combines sign-in and sign-up in one professional interface
- Allows institution type selection (K-12 or Higher Ed)
- Provides immediate access after account creation
- No email verification required to start

### Customer Journey:
```
1. Marketing/Home Page
   ↓
2. /get-started (Unified Entry)
   - Choose: Sign In or Sign Up
   - Select institution type
   - Fill in details
   ↓
3. Immediate Access
   - Auto-login after signup
   - No email verification delay
   ↓
4. /welcome (New User Onboarding)
   - Personalized welcome
   - Quick tour
   - Action items
   ↓
5. /dashboard/personalized
   - Full platform access
   - 7-day trial active
```

## Key Features

### 1. Unified Get Started Page (`/get-started`)
- **Single page for both login and signup**
- **Tab switcher** between "Sign In" and "Create Account"
- **Institution type selector** with visual icons

### 3. Automatic Redirects
- `/start` → `/get-started`
- `/auth/signup` → `/get-started`
- Old signup parameter URLs → `/get-started`
- Home page → `/get-started`

## What's Different
