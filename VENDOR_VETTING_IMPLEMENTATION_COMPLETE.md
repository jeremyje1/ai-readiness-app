# Vendor Vetting & Tool Approval System Implementation

## Overview
The Vendor Vetting & Tool Approval System is the third core module of the AI Governance Platform, designed to transform the $995/month subscription into a comprehensive "turn-key AI governance + implementation program" by providing automated compliance screening and board-ready decision briefs for GenAI tool approvals.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. VendorVettingSystem Class (`/lib/vendor-vetting-system.ts`)
**Purpose**: Core vendor assessment engine with automated compliance checking

**Key Interfaces**:
```typescript
interface VendorIntakeForm {
  submittedBy: string
  toolName: string
  vendorName: string
  // ... comprehensive intake fields
}

interface RiskAssessment {
  overallRiskScore: number
  riskLevel: 'Low' | 'Medium' | 'High' | 'Critical'
  coppaAssessment: ComplianceCheck
  ferpaAssessment: ComplianceCheck
  ppraAssessment: ComplianceCheck
  // ... detailed risk categories
}

interface DecisionBrief {
  executiveSummary: string
  recommendation: 'Approve' | 'Conditional Approval' | 'Reject'
  keyBenefits: string[]
  primaryConcerns: string[]
  // ... board-ready decision elements
}
```

- Advanced search and filtering by role, subject, grade level
- Comprehensive intake form with data handling and privacy questions
- Real-time status tracking for submitted tools
- Compliance status indicators and usage analytics

#### 4. Database Schema (`/database-migrations/20240820_vendor_vetting_system.sql`)
**Purpose**: Complete relational database structure for vendor vetting
**Key Tables**:
- `vendor_profiles`: Basic vendor information and trust levels
- `vendor_tools`: Specific tools from vendors with technical specifications
- `vendor_intake_forms`: Initial submission data with comprehensive metadata
- `risk_assessments`: Automated and manual risk evaluations
- `decision_briefs`: Board-ready decision documents

- `compliance_monitoring`: Ongoing compliance tracking
- `usage_analytics`: Tool usage tracking and analytics
- `vendor_vetting_audit`: Complete audit trail

#### 5. Platform Integration (`/app/ai-readiness/[assessmentId]/governance-platform/page.tsx`)
**Purpose**: Unified AI Governance Platform integrating all three core modules
**Key Features**:
- Dashboard showing ROI metrics and monthly value justification
- Tabbed interface for Assessment 2.0, Policy Pack Library, and Vendor Vetting
- Real-time metrics: documents processed, policies generated, tools vetted, compliance score
- Monthly value breakdown justifying $995/month subscription

## Monthly Value Proposition

### Vendor Vetting & Tool Approval Module: $395/month Value
1. **Automated Compliance Screening**: COPPA/FERPA/PPRA checks eliminating manual review time
2. **Board-Ready Decision Briefs**: One-page summaries with recommendations reducing preparation time
3. **Approved Tool Catalog**: Searchable registry preventing redundant evaluations
4. **Ongoing Compliance Monitoring**: Continuous tracking preventing violations

### Integrated Platform Value: $995/month Justification
- **Assessment 2.0**: $350/month (Document processing + policy generation)
- **Policy Pack Library**: $250/month (Maintained templates + monthly redlines)
- **Vendor Vetting System**: $395/month (Compliance screening + tool approvals)
- **Total Monthly Value**: $995+ delivered through concrete, measurable services

## Technical Implementation

### Risk Assessment Algorithm
```typescript
calculateRiskScore(form: VendorIntakeForm): RiskAssessment {
  // Privacy risk factors
  let privacyScore = this.assessPrivacyRisk(form)
  
  // Security risk factors
  let securityScore = this.assessSecurityRisk(form)
  
  // Compliance risk factors (COPPA/FERPA/PPRA)
  let complianceScore = this.assessComplianceRisk(form)
  
  // Weighted overall score
  const overallScore = (privacyScore * 0.4) + (securityScore * 0.3) + (complianceScore * 0.3)
  
  return {
    overallRiskScore: overallScore,
    riskLevel: this.determineRiskLevel(overallScore),
    // ... detailed assessments
  }
}
```

### Compliance Checks
- **COPPA Compliance**: Verifies under-13 user protections, parental consent mechanisms
- **FERPA Compliance**: Ensures educational record privacy and disclosure controls
- **PPRA Compliance**: Validates survey/analysis protections for K-12 students

### Decision Brief Generation
Automated creation of board-ready documents including:
- Executive summary with key findings
- Risk level assessment with mitigation strategies
- Implementation timeline and monitoring plan
- Financial analysis and budget impact
- Voting recommendations with supporting rationale

## Usage Workflows

### 1. Submit New Tool for Review
1. User completes comprehensive intake form
2. System performs automated compliance screening
3. Risk assessment algorithm calculates scores
4. Decision brief generated for board review
5. Tool approved/rejected with detailed rationale

### 2. Browse Approved Tools
1. Search/filter by role, subject, grade level
2. View usage guidelines and restrictions
3. Access training materials and documentation
