CRITICAL FIX: HTML Structure Corruption
--------------------------------------
Fixed broken HTML structure in K12 marketing page where navigation code
was incorrectly inserted into the meta description tag

ISSUE FIXED:
-----------
The meta description tag contained navigation HTML elements that broke the page layout:
- Logo image tag
- Navigation menu items  
- Button elements
All were incorrectly placed inside the meta description content attribute

CHANGES MADE:
------------
1. Removed 15 lines of misplaced navigation HTML from the meta description
2. Properly closed the meta description tag
3. Ensured proper HTML structure with navigation only in body section

FIXED STRUCTURE:
---------------
- Meta description now properly contains only text content
- Navigation remains correctly placed in the body section
- No duplicate navigation elements

VERIFICATION STEPS:
------------------
1. Load k12-marketing-page.html in browser
2. Verify page displays correctly without formatting issues
3. Check that navigation menu appears only once
4. Ensure meta tags are properly formed in page source

This fix ensures the K12 marketing page displays correctly with proper HTML structure.
