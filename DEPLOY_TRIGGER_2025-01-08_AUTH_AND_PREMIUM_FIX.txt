# DEPLOYMENT TRIGGER - January 8, 2025

## Authentication and Premium Subscription Fixes

### Changes Deployed:
1. **Fixed Payment Status API (401 Errors)**
   - Rewrote `/api/payments/status/route.ts` with new createClient pattern
   - Removed complex timeout logic that was causing issues
   - Simplified to direct database check for active subscription

2. **Added Clear Upgrade CTAs**
   - Desktop: Prominent gradient "Upgrade to Premium" button before user email
   - Mobile: Full-width upgrade button in dropdown menu
   - Only shows for non-premium users
   - Links to pricing page

3. **Made Premium Menu Conditional**
   - Premium dropdown only appears for active subscribers
   - Non-subscribers see upgrade CTA instead
   - Better user journey clarity

### Technical Details:
- Uses `useSubscription` hook in AuthNav
- Simplified auth flow prevents timeout issues
- Clear visual hierarchy for conversion path

### Testing Notes:
- Test signup → assessment → blueprint → upgrade flow
- Verify no 401 errors on payment status check
- Confirm upgrade buttons appear for non-premium users
- Check premium menu shows only for subscribers

### Files Changed:
- `/app/api/payments/status/route.ts`
- `/components/AuthNav.tsx`
- Created documentation files
